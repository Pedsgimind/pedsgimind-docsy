## For Clinicians (Quick Links)

### Triage & Red Flags
- **Bilious vomiting in newborn** → urgent evaluation for obstruction/volvulus until proven otherwise  
- **Food bolus with drooling / inability to handle secretions** → urgent endoscopic capability  
- **Hematochezia + systemic illness** → consider colitis, intussusception, sepsis in infant, IBD in older child  
- **Chronic abdominal pain + weight loss / nocturnal symptoms / anemia** → evaluate organic causes

### Algorithms (Coming Soon)
- Recurrent abdominal pain: functional vs organic (Nov 30 post below)  
- Dysphagia/choking/globus differentiation (Nov 25 post below)  
- Post-choking food refusal (Nov 20 post below)  
- Detailed abdominal pain triage + constipation algorithm + celiac/IBD testing triggers (Nov 15 post below)
