# Dr. Mohammad Hussein, MD, FRCPC (Canada)

**Pediatric Gastroenterology & Hepatology**

I am a Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada (RCPSC)–certified pediatrician and pediatric gastroenterologist. My clinical work focuses on evidence-based, family-centered care for infants, children, and adolescents with gastrointestinal, liver, nutrition, and feeding concerns.

**Clinical interests:** Pediatric gastroenterology • Hepatology • Nutrition • Endoscopy

## Clinical focus

My day-to-day practice commonly includes:

- Abdominal pain (functional and organic), reflux, vomiting, and feeding difficulties
- Chronic diarrhea, constipation, and fecal incontinence (including refractory constipation pathways)
- Celiac disease and food-related conditions (including eosinophilic gastrointestinal disorders)
- Inflammatory bowel disease (including very early onset inflammatory bowel disease), biologic therapy follow-up, and infusion care pathways
- Gastrointestinal bleeding and anemia evaluation (upper and lower), including endoscopic hemostasis when indicated
- Hepatobiliary disorders (including neonatal cholestasis and portal hypertension/variceal care) and pancreatitis care, including post–liver transplant follow-up when relevant
- Nutrition support (enteral and parenteral), growth concerns, selective/restrictive eating, and obesity/metabolic risk
- Gastrointestinal concerns in neurodevelopmental conditions (for example, Autism Spectrum Disorder), with a practical, family-centered approach

## Procedures and testing

Where appropriate, I integrate pediatric GI procedures and functional testing into care, including:

- Upper endoscopy and colonoscopy (diagnostic and therapeutic), including:
  - Biopsies (for example, celiac disease, eosinophilic esophagitis, inflammatory bowel disease)
  - Polypectomy (upper and lower gastrointestinal tract)
  - Foreign body removal
  - Hemostasis of bleeding lesions (injection, clipping, cautery when indicated)
  - Esophageal dilation for strictures (for example, post-repair esophageal atresia, achalasia-related, or reflux-related strictures)
  - Variceal therapy when clinically indicated
- PEG and PEC care pathways (including program development and long-term follow-up)
- Capsule endoscopy (performance and interpretation)
- Functional and motility testing (when available and clinically indicated):
  - pH monitoring and dual pH–impedance studies
  - Hydrogen/methane breath testing
  - Anorectal manometry
- Percutaneous liver biopsy (ultrasound-guided), when clinically indicated and available within the care setting
