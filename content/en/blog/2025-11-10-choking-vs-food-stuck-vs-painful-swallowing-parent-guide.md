Parents often hear “I’m choking” when a child actually means “it hurts to swallow” or “it feels stuck.”

This guide clarifies the three common scenarios:

---

## 1) True choking (airway emergency)
Signs:
- Cannot breathe, speak, or cough effectively
- Blue color, severe distress
- Sudden onset while eating

Action:
- Emergency response and immediate medical care.

---

## 2) Food stuck (esophagus: food bolus)
Signs:
- Child points to middle chest
- Needs water to push food down
- Drooling / cannot swallow saliva (severe impaction)

Action:
- If drooling/can’t swallow saliva: ER now.
- If mild and passes: arrange evaluation if recurrent.

---

## 3) Painful swallowing (odynophagia)
Signs:
- Swallowing causes pain
- Child avoids eating due to pain
- Can occur with throat infections, pill irritation, reflux inflammation

Action:
- Assess hydration.
- Seek care if pain is severe, persistent, or associated with weight loss or dysphagia symptoms.

---

## Quick summary
- Airway choking is the true emergency.
- Food stuck is an esophagus problem and can be urgent if secretions can’t be handled.
- Painful swallowing needs evaluation if it persists or limits intake.
