After a choking or gagging incident, some children develop a strong fear of swallowing. They may refuse solids, chew and spit, or only accept liquids/soft foods. This can be a short-term reaction — but it can also uncover an underlying swallowing problem.

---

## 1) First priority: safety red flags
Seek urgent assessment if:
- Drooling or inability to swallow saliva
- Coughing/choking with liquids
- Wet/gurgly voice after swallowing
- Breathing difficulty
- Weight loss, dehydration, very low urine output

---

## 2) Why this happens
Common reasons include:
- **Fear memory** after a scary event (child avoids repeating it)
- Increased gag sensitivity
- Painful swallowing from inflammation/reflux
- Underlying dysphagia (EoE/stricture) that contributed to the event

---

## 3) What parents can do (step-by-step plan)
### Step A: Keep the child hydrated
- Offer water and preferred fluids
- Offer smooth textures your child accepts (yogurt, soup, smoothies)

### Step B: Reduce pressure
- No forcing, bribing, or threats
- Keep mealtimes calm and short

### Step C: Rebuild swallowing confidence gradually
Progress from easiest to harder:
1. Smooth purees
2. Soft mashable solids (banana, scrambled egg)
3. Soft bite-sized foods
4. Firmer textures (meat/bread) only after confidence returns

### Step D: Watch for “medical clues”
Seek evaluation if:
- Child consistently needs water to swallow bites
- Avoids meat/bread/rice long-term
- Slow eater or recurrent stuck episodes
- Chest discomfort with swallowing

---

## 4) When to request feeding therapy or specialist review
Consider speech/feeding therapy if:
- Food refusal lasts > 1–2 weeks
- Progress is stalled
- Anxiety around eating is severe

Consider GI evaluation if dysphagia symptoms suggest EoE or narrowing.

---

## Quick summary
- Many children recover with calm support and gradual texture steps.
- Persistent avoidance or “food stuck” symptoms need medical evaluation.
- Safety comes first: drooling, choking with liquids, or dehydration requires urgent care.
