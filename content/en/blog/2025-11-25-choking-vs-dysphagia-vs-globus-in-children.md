Parents often hear: “Food is stuck,” “I can’t swallow,” or “Something is in my throat.” These can mean very different things.

This guide helps you tell the difference between:
- **Choking (airway problem)** — can be life-threatening
- **Dysphagia (esophagus problem)** — food sticks in the chest
- **Globus (sensation in throat)** — often stress/reflux-related

---

## 1) Choking (airway problem) — emergency signs
Choking involves the **airway**, not the swallowing tube.

Emergency signs:
- Cannot breathe or speak
- Blue lips, severe distress
- High-pitched noisy breathing
- Persistent coughing with inability to clear
- Sudden onset while eating (especially small round foods)

If your child has trouble breathing: seek emergency care immediately.

## 2) Dysphagia (esophagus problem): “food stuck in the chest”
Typical clues:
- Points to **middle of chest**
- Needs water to push food down
- Avoids meat/bread/rice
- Eats slowly, chews excessively
- Recurrent “stuck” episodes

Important causes include:
- **Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE)**
- Narrowing/stricture/rings
- Reflux-related inflammation

Repeated dysphagia episodes should be evaluated.

## 3) Globus sensation: “lump in throat” feeling
Globus is usually:
- A sensation in the throat
- Often not linked to meals
- Swallowing is still possible
- Can fluctuate with stress or anxiety
- Can be associated with reflux or postnasal drip

Red flags with throat symptoms:
- True progressive swallowing difficulty
- Weight loss
- Persistent voice change
- Persistent pain with swallowing

---

## 4) When is “food stuck” an emergency?
Emergency if:
- Drooling / cannot swallow saliva
- Cannot drink liquids
- Significant distress
- Breathing problems
- Suspected button battery or sharp object

---

## Quick summary
- Choking = airway emergency.
- Dysphagia = food sticking in the chest, often needs evaluation (EoE is common).
- Globus = throat sensation, often benign but needs assessment if red flags exist.
