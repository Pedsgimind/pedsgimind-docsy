# 🍞🚫 Celiac Disease in Children
*Symptoms, who should be tested, how testing works, and what to do next*

> ✅ **Quick note:** Celiac disease is an immune reaction to **gluten** (in wheat, barley, and rye) that can damage the small intestine. Some children have obvious tummy symptoms, but many have **subtle signs** like poor growth, anemia, fatigue, headaches, mouth ulcers, or constipation. The most important rule: **do not start a gluten-free diet before testing**.

---

## 🧾 Quick “At-a-glance” box (top of page)

> ✅ **Condition name + common names:** Celiac disease (also called “celiac sprue” in older medical writing)  
>
> **What it is (2–3 lines):** Gluten triggers an immune reaction that injures the small intestine’s lining (where nutrients are absorbed). This can cause diarrhea, belly pain, bloating—or show up as poor growth, iron deficiency anemia, fatigue, constipation, headaches, or delayed puberty.  
>
> **Who it affects (typical ages):** Any age (toddlers, school-age children, teens). Symptoms can be gradual and easy to miss.  
>
> ✅ **What parents should do today:**  
> - **Keep gluten in the diet** until testing is complete.  
> - Track symptoms (stool, belly pain, energy) and growth if you know it.  
> - Book a visit to discuss the right blood tests.  
>
> ⚠️ **Red flags that need urgent/ER care:**  
> - Significant dehydration (very low urine, very sleepy, very dry mouth)  
> - Persistent vomiting (especially green/bright yellow bile)  
> - Severe weakness, fainting, or child looks very unwell  
> - Large blood in stool or black/tarry stools  
>
> 🟡 **When to see the family doctor/clinic soon:**  
> - Poor growth, weight loss, fatigue, pallor (possible anemia)  
> - Chronic diarrhea, persistent belly pain/bloating, constipation that won’t improve  
> - Mouth ulcers, headaches, delayed puberty  
> - High-risk groups: type 1 diabetes, autoimmune thyroid disease, first-degree relative with celiac disease

## 🧠 What it is (plain language)

Celiac disease is an **immune condition** (not an infection). When a child with celiac eats gluten, the immune system reacts and can damage the small intestine lining. Over time, that can lead to:
- Poor absorption of nutrients (especially iron and some vitamins)
- Poor growth or weight loss
- Low energy and tummy symptoms

> ✅ **Important:** Celiac disease is **not** the same as “gluten intolerance” and it is **not** a typical food allergy. The treatment is still a strict gluten-free diet—but **the diagnosis must be confirmed properly**.

### What part of the body is involved? (small diagram required)

<!-- AI IMAGE PROMPT: Friendly diagram showing stomach → small intestine with villi. Panel A: healthy villi labeled “absorbs nutrients.” Panel B: inflamed/flattened villi labeled “harder to absorb nutrients.” Add wheat/barley/rye icon → immune reaction arrow. Not scary, clean design. -->

### Common myths vs facts (short)
- **Myth:** “Celiac always causes diarrhea.”  
  **Fact:** Many children have constipation, belly pain, anemia, fatigue, headaches, or growth issues instead.
- **Myth:** “Let’s go gluten-free first and see if it helps.”  
  **Fact:** Going gluten-free early can make tests falsely normal and **delay or miss diagnosis**.
- **Myth:** “A little gluten won’t matter.”  
  **Fact:** In celiac disease, even small exposures can keep inflammation active.

## 🧩 Why it happens (causes & triggers)

### Common causes
- Celiac happens in children with a genetic tendency (often runs in families).  
- Gluten exposure triggers an immune reaction.  
- This injures the small intestine lining and affects absorption.

### Less common but important causes (brief)
- Celiac-like symptoms can also come from other conditions (for example: IBD, infections, thyroid disease). Your clinician decides what else to check based on symptoms.

### Triggers that worsen symptoms
- Ongoing gluten intake (including “hidden gluten”)  
- Cross-contamination (shared toaster, cutting boards, flour dust, shared spreads)  
- Intercurrent illness may worsen symptoms temporarily (but gluten drives ongoing injury)

### Risk factors (age, family history, exposures)
- First-degree relative with celiac disease  
- Type 1 diabetes  
- Autoimmune thyroid disease  
- Down syndrome or Turner syndrome  
- Selective IgA deficiency  
- Unexplained iron deficiency anemia, poor growth, chronic GI symptoms

## 👀 What parents might notice (symptoms)

### Typical symptoms (most common first)
- Belly pain or bloating  
- Diarrhea **or** constipation  
- Fatigue/low energy  
- Poor appetite or persistent picky eating beyond expected  
- Slow growth or weight loss  
- Headaches  
- Mouth ulcers  
- Pale skin (possible anemia)

### Symptoms by age group

#### Infant / toddler
- Poor weight gain or slowed growth  
- Chronic diarrhea or bulky/foul stools (sometimes constipation)  
- Bloating, belly pain  
- Irritability, low energy

#### School-age
- Recurrent abdominal pain, nausea  
- Fatigue, headaches  
- Constipation or diarrhea  
- Iron deficiency anemia  
- Slower growth

#### Teens
- Fatigue, headaches, abdominal symptoms  
- Iron deficiency anemia  
- Delayed puberty  
- Short stature compared with family expectations  
- Mood changes can occur (often from fatigue/illness impact)

### What’s normal vs what’s not normal
- ✅ **Can still be celiac:** mild belly pain, constipation, “just tired,” or mild anemia  
- ⚠️ **Not normal:** dehydration, persistent vomiting, significant weight loss, fainting, black/tarry stools, large bleeding

### Symptom trackers (what to write down)
- Stool pattern (frequency, diarrhea/constipation, urgency)  
- Belly pain (timing, triggers)  
- Energy, sleep, school performance  
- Appetite and food patterns  
- Weight/height trend if known  
- Headaches, mouth ulcers  
- Family history or autoimmune diagnoses

---

## 🏠 Home care and what helps (step-by-step)

### What to do in the first 24–48 hours
> ✅ **Do this now:**  
- **Do not start gluten-free** if testing is planned.  
- Book a clinic visit for celiac blood testing.  
- Start a symptom tracker + 3-day food diary (helpful for your clinician).  
- Keep hydration steady.

### Supportive care: fluids, nutrition, sleep, comfort measures
- Hydration and regular meals/snacks  
- Gentle foods if stomach upset is present  
- If constipation: increase fluids and fiber gradually; consider a clinician-guided stool-softening plan if needed  
- Prioritize sleep (fatigue is common)

### What usually makes it worse
- Stopping gluten before testing  
- Unplanned diet restrictions that reduce calories/nutrients  
- Ongoing constipation without a structured plan  
- Repeated “trial diets” without medical guidance

---

## ⛔ What NOT to do (common mistakes)

- Do **not** start gluten-free before testing unless a clinician specifically instructs you to (rare urgent situations).  
- Do **not** use home “gluten sensitivity tests” as a substitute for medical testing.  
- Do **not** assume normal stools mean no celiac.  
- Do **not** stop follow-up after diagnosis—monitoring is important.

### When not to give over-the-counter medications
- Avoid anti-diarrhea medicines in children unless a clinician directs it—especially if there is blood, fever, or dehydration risk.  
- If belly pain needs frequent pain medicine, book a medical review.

---

## 🚦 When to worry: triage guidance

### 🔴 Call 911 / Emergency now
- Collapse, severe weakness, very hard to wake  
- Severe breathing difficulty

**Example:** “My child is fainting or is not responding normally.”

### 🟠 Same-day urgent visit
- Dehydration (no urine 8–12 hours, very dry mouth, very sleepy/dizzy)  
- Persistent vomiting (especially green/bright yellow bile)  
- Large blood in stool or black/tarry stools  
- Child looks very unwell

**Example:** “They can’t keep fluids down and haven’t peed all day.”

### 🟡 Book a routine appointment
- Ongoing belly pain, bloating, diarrhea, constipation  
- Fatigue, headaches, mouth ulcers  
- Poor growth/weight loss or delayed puberty  
- Iron deficiency anemia  
- High-risk group (type 1 diabetes, autoimmune thyroid disease, first-degree relative)

**Example:** “Iron keeps coming back low and they’re tired for months.”

### 🟢 Watch at home
- Mild symptoms with stable hydration and energy while awaiting clinic appointment/testing  
- No red flags and your child is otherwise functioning normally

---

## 🩺 How doctors diagnose it (what to expect)

### What the clinician will ask
- Symptom details and timeline  
- Stool pattern and belly pain  
- Growth and appetite  
- Family history of celiac/autoimmune disease  
- Whether gluten is still being eaten (this matters)

### Physical exam basics
- Accurate height/weight and growth curve review  
- Signs of anemia (pallor), dehydration  
- Belly exam  
- Puberty assessment if delayed puberty is a concern

### Possible tests (and why)
**Celiac blood tests (while still eating gluten):**
- A celiac antibody test (often called “tTG”)  
- A test to confirm normal IgA level (important to interpret results)

If tests are positive (or suspicion is high), confirmation depends on local pediatric pathways and may involve:
- Referral to pediatric gastroenterology  
- Sometimes endoscopy with small intestine biopsies  
- Sometimes a no-biopsy confirmation pathway in selected children (program-dependent)

### What tests are usually not needed
- Removing gluten as a “test” before proper bloodwork  
- Broad testing without first doing the correct celiac blood tests when the history fits

### What results might mean (simple interpretation)
- **Negative tests while eating gluten:** celiac is less likely (but your clinician interprets in context)  
- **Positive tests:** higher likelihood; confirmation pathway matters  
- **IgA deficiency:** different antibody tests may be needed (your clinician guides this)

## 🧰 Treatment options

### First-line treatment
> ✅ **Strict gluten-free diet** (lifelong once diagnosis is confirmed)

### If not improving (next steps)
- Dietitian review (hidden gluten and cross-contamination are common)  
- Check and replace nutrients if needed (iron, vitamin D, sometimes others)  
- Reassessment if symptoms persist despite confirmed strict gluten-free diet

### Severe cases (hospital care)
- Significant dehydration, severe vomiting  
- Severe weakness or concerning anemia symptoms  
- Child looks very unwell

### For each treatment, include key details

#### Gluten-free diet (core treatment)
- **What it does:** stops immune injury and allows healing  
- **How to do it well:** label-reading, family education, school plan, cross-contamination prevention  
- **Common “side effects”:** feeling overwhelmed at first; accidental exposures are common early on  
- **Serious risks if not done strictly:** ongoing inflammation, poor growth, anemia  
- **When to seek help:** persistent symptoms, weight loss, ongoing fatigue, repeated exposures  
- **Key interactions:** gluten can hide in sauces, soups, processed meats, seasonings, shared fryers, and flour dust

---

## ⏳ Expected course & prognosis

### Typical timeline
- Many kids feel better within **weeks** after strict gluten-free diet begins  
- Energy and stool patterns improve gradually  
- Growth catch-up can take **months** (longer if diagnosis was delayed)  
- Blood tests used for monitoring usually improve over time (timeline varies)

### What “getting better” looks like
- Better appetite and energy  
- Less belly pain/bloating  
- Improved stool pattern  
- Growth curve stabilizes and improves

### What “getting worse” looks like
- Continued weight loss or fatigue  
- Persistent diarrhea or vomiting  
- Ongoing anemia  
- New concerning symptoms (blood in stool, black stools)

### Return to school/daycare/sports guidance
- Return as soon as hydrated and comfortable  
- Provide a clear school plan for gluten-free meals/snacks and food events

---

## ⚠️ Complications (brief but clear)

### Common complications (if untreated)
- Iron deficiency anemia  
- Poor growth or delayed puberty  
- Low bone mineral density (vitamin D/calcium issues)

### Rare serious complications (red-flag reminder)
- Severe malnutrition (uncommon)  
- Persistent symptoms despite strict diet requires reassessment (cross-contamination or alternate diagnoses)

---

## 🛡️ Prevention and reducing future episodes

Celiac disease itself is not preventable, but complications are reduced by:
- Correct diagnosis (testing while still eating gluten)  
- Strict gluten-free diet once confirmed  
- Ongoing follow-up and nutrition monitoring  
- Family/caregiver education on cross-contamination

---

## 🌟 Special situations

### Infants
- Symptoms can be subtle; dehydration and poor feeding require prompt assessment.

### Teens
- Social eating and school events need planning; fatigue and low iron are common presentations.

### Kids with chronic conditions (asthma, diabetes, immunosuppression)
- Type 1 diabetes and autoimmune thyroid disease increase risk—testing threshold is lower.  
- Coordinate diet changes with the care team to keep nutrition balanced.

### Neurodevelopmental differences/autism
- Keep changes structured and predictable; involve a dietitian to avoid unnecessary restriction.

### Travel considerations
- Pack gluten-free snacks; learn label terms; plan for cross-contamination.

### School/daycare notes (what teachers should know)
- Gluten-free diet is strict and medical  
- Avoid food sharing  
- Plan for celebrations, crafts with flour, and snack policies

---

## 📅 Follow-up plan

### When to follow up and with whom
- Follow-up with your clinician and dietitian after diagnosis  
- Pediatric gastroenterology follow-up as advised by your local pathway

### What would trigger earlier follow-up
- Persistent symptoms despite strict diet  
- Weight loss or poor growth  
- Persistent fatigue/anemia  
- Repeated suspected gluten exposures

### What to bring to the appointment
- Symptom diary, stool notes  
- Growth measurements (if known)  
- Food diary (including drinks)  
- Medication/supplement list  
- Questions about label-reading and cross-contamination

## ❓ Parent FAQs

### “Is it contagious?”
No.

### “Can my child eat ___?”
If diagnosed, foods must be gluten-free. Many foods are naturally gluten-free (fruit, vegetables, meat, fish, eggs, beans, rice, potatoes) if not contaminated.

### “Can they bathe/swim/exercise?”
Yes.

### “Will they outgrow it?”
Celiac disease is lifelong, but most children do extremely well with a strict gluten-free diet.

### “When can we stop treatment?”
Once confirmed, the gluten-free diet is lifelong.
