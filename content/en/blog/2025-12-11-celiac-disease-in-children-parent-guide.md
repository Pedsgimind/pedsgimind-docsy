# Celiac Disease in Children
*Symptoms, who should be tested, how testing works, and what to do next*

> **Key rule:** If you suspect celiac disease, **keep gluten in your child’s diet until testing is complete**. Starting gluten-free too early can make tests falsely normal.

## Quick “At-a-glance” box

**Condition name:** Celiac disease  
**Also called:** “Celiac sprue” (older term)

**What it is (2–3 lines):**  
Gluten (wheat, barley, rye) triggers an immune reaction that injures the small intestine lining where nutrients are absorbed. Some children have diarrhea and belly pain, but many have subtle signs like fatigue, poor growth, constipation, or iron deficiency anemia. With diagnosis and a strict gluten-free diet, most children do very well.

**Who it affects (typical ages):**  
Any age (toddlers through teens). Symptoms can be gradual and easy to miss.

**What parents should do today:**
- **Do not start a gluten-free diet** if testing is planned.
- Track symptoms (stool pattern, belly pain, energy) and any growth concerns.
- Book a visit to discuss the correct celiac blood tests.

**Red flags (urgent / Emergency Department):**
- Dehydration (very low urine, very sleepy, very dry mouth)
- Persistent vomiting (especially green or bright yellow bile)
- Severe weakness, fainting, or child looks very unwell
- Large blood in stool or black/tarry stools

**Book a clinic visit soon (non-emergency):**
- Ongoing belly pain/bloating, diarrhea, or constipation that will not improve
- Fatigue, pallor, headaches, mouth ulcers
- Poor growth, weight loss, delayed puberty
- Higher-risk groups (type 1 diabetes, autoimmune thyroid disease, first-degree relative with celiac disease)

## What it is (plain language)

Celiac disease is an **immune condition** (not an infection). When a child with celiac eats gluten, the immune system reacts and can damage the small intestine lining. Over time this can lead to:
- Poor absorption of nutrients (especially **iron** and some vitamins)
- Low energy and fatigue
- Belly symptoms (diarrhea, constipation, bloating, pain)
- Poor growth or weight loss

**Important:** Celiac disease is not the same as “gluten intolerance,” and it is not a typical food allergy. The treatment is a strict gluten-free diet—but **the diagnosis needs proper testing first**.

### Myths vs facts
- **Myth:** “Celiac always causes diarrhea.”  
  **Fact:** Many children have constipation, belly pain, fatigue, headaches, anemia, or growth concerns instead.
- **Myth:** “Let’s try gluten-free first to see if it helps.”  
  **Fact:** Going gluten-free early can make tests falsely normal and delay or miss the diagnosis.
- **Myth:** “A little gluten won’t matter.”  
  **Fact:** In celiac disease, small exposures can keep inflammation active.

---

## Why it happens (causes & triggers)

**Why celiac happens:**
- A child has a genetic tendency (often runs in families).
- Gluten exposure triggers an immune reaction.
- The small intestine lining becomes inflamed, affecting absorption.

**What can make symptoms worse:**
- Ongoing gluten intake (including “hidden gluten”)
- Cross-contamination (shared toaster, cutting boards, flour dust, shared spreads)
- Illness and stress can worsen symptoms temporarily, but gluten exposure drives ongoing injury.

**Who is at higher risk:**
- First-degree relative with celiac disease
- Type 1 diabetes
- Autoimmune thyroid disease
- Down syndrome or Turner syndrome
- Selective immunoglobulin A deficiency
- Unexplained iron deficiency anemia, poor growth, chronic gastrointestinal symptoms

## Symptoms parents might notice

### Common symptoms
- Belly pain or bloating
- Diarrhea **or** constipation
- Fatigue/low energy
- Poor appetite or persistent picky eating beyond what feels typical
- Slow growth or weight loss
- Headaches
- Mouth ulcers
- Pale skin (possible anemia)

### Symptoms by age

**Infants / toddlers**
- Poor weight gain or slowed growth
- Diarrhea or bulky/foul stools (sometimes constipation)
- Bloating, belly pain
- Irritability, low energy

**School-age children**
- Recurrent abdominal pain, nausea
- Fatigue, headaches
- Constipation or diarrhea
- Iron deficiency anemia
- Slower growth

**Teens**
- Fatigue, headaches, abdominal symptoms
- Iron deficiency anemia
- Delayed puberty
- Short stature compared with family expectations

### A helpful symptom tracker (what to write down)
- Stool pattern (frequency, diarrhea/constipation, urgency, accidents)
- Belly pain (timing, location, triggers)
- Energy and sleep
- Appetite and “safe foods”
- Hydration (urine frequency, dizziness)
- Any growth concerns (weight/height trend if known)
- Family history of celiac or autoimmune conditions

---

## What to do at home (while you arrange testing)

### In the next 24–48 hours
- Keep gluten in the diet if you plan to test.
- Book an appointment for celiac blood tests.
- Start a simple symptom tracker and a 3-day food/drink diary.
- Focus on hydration and regular meals/snacks.

### Supportive care
- Keep routines steady (sleep, school, meals) if your child is otherwise well.
- If constipation is present: fluids, fiber gradually, and discuss a stool-softening plan with your clinician if needed.
- Avoid major diet restrictions without guidance—children can lose calories quickly.

### What to avoid
- Starting gluten-free before testing
- Multiple “trial diets” at the same time (can confuse symptoms and reduce nutrition)
- Using anti-diarrhea medicines unless a clinician advises it (especially if blood, fever, or dehydration risk)

---

## When to worry (simple triage)

**Emergency now (911 / Emergency Department):**
- Severe trouble breathing
- Collapse, fainting, or extremely hard to wake

**Same-day urgent assessment:**
- Dehydration (no urine 8–12 hours, very sleepy/dizzy, very dry mouth)
- Persistent vomiting (especially green/bright yellow bile)
- Large blood in stool or black/tarry stools
- Child looks very unwell

**Book a routine appointment:**
- Ongoing belly symptoms (pain, bloating, diarrhea, constipation)
- Fatigue, pallor, headaches, mouth ulcers
- Poor growth/weight loss or delayed puberty
- Iron deficiency anemia
- Any higher-risk group (type 1 diabetes, autoimmune thyroid disease, close relative with celiac)

---

## How doctors test for celiac disease (what to expect)

### The key point
Testing is most accurate when your child is **still eating gluten**.

### Common first tests
Most clinicians start with:
- A celiac antibody blood test (often called **tTG**)
- A blood test to confirm normal **IgA** level (important for accurate interpretation)

If blood tests are positive (or suspicion remains high), the next step depends on local pediatric pathways and may include:
- Referral to pediatric gastroenterology
- Sometimes endoscopy with biopsies
- Sometimes a “no-biopsy” confirmation pathway in selected children (program-dependent)

---

## Treatment (after diagnosis is confirmed)

### Main treatment
A **strict gluten-free diet** (lifelong once diagnosis is confirmed).

### Practical essentials that matter most
- Learn the main gluten sources: wheat, barley, rye
- Read labels every time (ingredients change)
- Prevent cross-contamination (separate toaster, clean surfaces, avoid shared spreads)
- Create a school plan (safe lunches/snacks; no food sharing)

### If symptoms do not improve
- Dietitian review (hidden gluten and cross-contamination are very common)
- Check and replace nutrients if needed (iron, vitamin D, and others based on your clinician)
- Reassessment if symptoms persist despite confirmed strict diet

---

## What to expect (timeline & prognosis)

- Many children feel better within **weeks** after starting a strict gluten-free diet.
- Energy and stool patterns often improve gradually.
- Growth catch-up can take **months**, especially if diagnosis was delayed.
- Follow-up bloodwork is often used to confirm improvement over time.
