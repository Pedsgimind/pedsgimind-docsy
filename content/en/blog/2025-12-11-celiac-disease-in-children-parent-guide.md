# 🍞🚫 Celiac Disease in Children  
*Symptoms, who should be tested, how testing works, and what to do next*

> ✅ **Quick note:** Celiac disease is an immune reaction to **gluten** (in wheat, barley, and rye) that can damage the small intestine. Some children have obvious tummy symptoms, but many have **subtle signs** like poor growth, anemia, fatigue, headaches, or constipation. The most important rule: **do not start a gluten-free diet before testing**.

---

## 🧾 Quick “At-a-glance” box

> ✅ **Condition name:** Celiac disease  
> **Also called:** Gluten-sensitive enteropathy (medical term), “celiac sprue” (older term)  
>
> **What it is (2–3 lines):** Gluten triggers an immune reaction that damages the small intestine, making it harder to absorb nutrients. It can cause diarrhea, belly pain, bloating—or show up as poor growth, anemia, fatigue, constipation, or delayed puberty.  
>
> **Who it affects (typical ages):** Any age (including toddlers and teens). Symptoms may start gradually and can be missed for months or years.  
>
> ✅ **What parents should do today:**  
> - If you suspect celiac, **keep gluten in the diet** until testing is complete.  
> - Start a symptom + growth tracker (pain, stool, energy, weight/height if known).  
> - Book a clinic visit to discuss the right blood tests.  
>
> ⚠️ **Red flags that need urgent / ER care:**  
> - Significant dehydration (very low urine, very dry mouth, very sleepy)  
> - Persistent vomiting (especially green/bright yellow bile)  
> - Severe weakness, fainting, or child looks very unwell  
> - Large blood in stool or black/tarry stools  
>
> 🟡 **When to see the family doctor/clinic soon:**  
> - Poor growth/weight loss, fatigue, pallor (possible anemia)  
> - Chronic diarrhea, persistent belly pain/bloating, or constipation that won’t improve  
> - Mouth ulcers, headaches, delayed puberty  
> - Type 1 diabetes or autoimmune thyroid disease (higher risk group)  
> - First-degree relative with celiac disease

## 🧠 What it is (plain language)

Celiac disease is an **immune** condition. When a child with celiac eats gluten, their immune system reacts and can injure the lining of the small intestine (where nutrients are absorbed). Over time, that can lead to:
- Poor absorption of iron and vitamins  
- Poor growth or weight loss  
- Low energy and tummy symptoms  

> ✅ **Important:** Celiac disease is **not** a food allergy, and it is **not** the same as “gluten intolerance.” The treatment is still a strict gluten-free diet—but the diagnosis and follow-up are different.

### What part of the body is involved? (small diagram required)

<!-- AI IMAGE PROMPT: Friendly diagram showing stomach → small intestine with “tiny finger-like lining” (villi) labeled. Show “healthy villi” vs “flattened villi after gluten-triggered inflammation.” Include a simple wheat/barley/rye icon leading to immune reaction arrow. Not scary; clean and parent-friendly. -->

### Common myths vs facts
- **Myth:** “Celiac always causes diarrhea.”  
  **Fact:** Many children have constipation, belly pain, anemia, fatigue, or growth issues instead.
- **Myth:** “We should try gluten-free first and see if they improve.”  
  **Fact:** Going gluten-free too early can make tests falsely normal and **delay the correct diagnosis**.
- **Myth:** “A little gluten won’t matter.”  
  **Fact:** In celiac disease, even small exposures can keep inflammation active.

---

## 🧩 Why it happens (causes & triggers)

### Why celiac happens
- A child has a genetic tendency (often runs in families).  
- Gluten exposure triggers an immune reaction.  
- The small intestine becomes inflamed, affecting absorption.

### Triggers that worsen symptoms
- Ongoing gluten intake (even small, repeated exposures)  
- Cross-contamination (tiny gluten from shared toasters, cutting boards, flour dust)  
- Intercurrent illness or stress may make symptoms feel worse (but gluten is the driver)

### Risk factors (who is more likely)
- First-degree relative with celiac disease  
- Type 1 diabetes  
- Autoimmune thyroid disease  
- Down syndrome or Turner syndrome  
- Selective immunoglobulin A deficiency  
- Unexplained iron deficiency anemia, poor growth, chronic GI symptoms

---

## 👀 What parents might notice (symptoms)

> ✅ Many children have **subtle** symptoms. Watch patterns over time.

### Typical symptoms (most common first)
- Belly pain or bloating  
- Diarrhea OR constipation  
- Fatigue/low energy  
- Poor appetite or picky eating beyond expected  
- Slow growth or weight loss  
- Headaches  
- Mouth ulcers  
- Pale skin (possible anemia)

### Symptoms by age group

#### Toddlers / young children
- Poor weight gain or slowed growth  
- Chronic diarrhea or bulky/foul stools (sometimes constipation instead)  
- Bloating, belly pain  
- Irritability, low energy

#### School-age children / teens
- Recurrent abdominal pain, nausea  
- Fatigue, headaches  
- Constipation or diarrhea  
- Iron-deficiency anemia  
- Short stature or delayed puberty  
- Mouth ulcers  
- Bone pain or fractures with minimal trauma (less common but important)

### What’s normal vs what’s not normal
- ✅ **Can still be celiac:** mild belly pain, constipation, “just tired,” mild anemia  
- ⚠️ **More concerning:** clear weight loss, persistent vomiting, significant diarrhea with dehydration, black/tarry stools, severe weakness/fainting

### Symptom tracker (what to write down)
- Stool pattern (diarrhea/constipation, frequency, accidents)  
- Belly pain location/timing  
- Energy level and sleep  
- Appetite and picky eating patterns  
- Weight/height trend if available  
- Headaches, mouth ulcers  
- Any family history or autoimmune diagnoses

---

## 🏠 Home care and what helps (step-by-step)

### What to do in the first 24–48 hours (if you suspect celiac)
> ✅ **Do this now:**  
- **Do not start gluten-free yet** if testing is planned.  
- Book an appointment for the right blood tests.  
- Support comfort: hydration, regular meals, gentle foods as tolerated.  
- Track symptoms and stool.

### Supportive care (while waiting for testing)
- Hydration and regular meals/snacks  
- Manage constipation gently (fluids, fiber gradually, toileting routine)  
- If diarrhea: focus on hydration; seek care if dehydration signs appear  
- Keep school routines as normal as possible if your child is stable

### What usually makes it worse
- Cutting gluten before testing (can delay diagnosis)  
- Repeated “diet trials” without a plan  
- Over-restriction leading to poor nutrition  
- Ignoring ongoing fatigue, pallor, or growth changes

---

## ⛔ What NOT to do (common mistakes)

- Do **not** start a gluten-free diet before testing unless a clinician specifically instructs you to for urgent reasons.  
- Do **not** rely on home “gluten sensitivity tests.”  
- Do **not** assume normal stool means no problem—celiac can present without diarrhea.  
- Do **not** stop follow-up after diagnosis; monitoring matters.

### When not to give over-the-counter medications
- Avoid frequent anti-diarrhea medicines in children unless directed by a clinician.  
- If your child needs frequent pain medicine for belly pain, book a medical review.

---

## 🚦 When to worry: triage guidance

### 🔴 Call 911 / Emergency now
- Collapse, severe weakness, very hard to wake  
- Severe breathing difficulty

**Example:** “My child is fainting or extremely sleepy and not responding normally.”

### 🟠 Same-day urgent visit
- Dehydration (no urine 8–12 hours, very dry mouth, very dizzy, very sleepy)  
- Persistent vomiting (especially green/bright yellow bile)  
- Large blood in stool or black/tarry stools  
- Child looks very unwell with severe symptoms

**Example:** “They can’t keep fluids down and haven’t peed all day.”

### 🟡 Book a routine appointment
- Ongoing belly pain, bloating, diarrhea, constipation  
- Fatigue, headaches, mouth ulcers  
- Poor growth/weight loss or delayed puberty  
- Iron deficiency anemia  
- High-risk group (type 1 diabetes, autoimmune thyroid disease, first-degree relative)

**Example:** “They’re tired for months and iron keeps coming back low.”

### 🟢 Watch at home
- Mild symptoms with stable hydration and energy while awaiting clinic appointment/testing  
- No red flags and child is functioning normally

---

## 🩺 How doctors diagnose it (what to expect)

### What the clinician will ask
- Symptoms and how long they’ve been happening  
- Stool pattern and belly pain details  
- Growth and appetite  
- Family history of celiac disease or autoimmune conditions  
- Any diagnoses like type 1 diabetes or thyroid disease  
- Current diet (including whether gluten is still being eaten)

### Physical exam basics
- Growth measurements (weight/height, growth curve)  
- Signs of anemia (pallor)  
- Belly exam  
- Hydration assessment  
- Puberty assessment if delayed puberty is a concern

### Possible tests (and why)

**Celiac blood tests (while still eating gluten):**
- Tissue transglutaminase antibody (often called “tTG”)  
- A test to confirm your child makes normal immunoglobulin A (IgA) levels (important for interpreting results)

If positive (or if suspicion is high), your clinician will follow a confirmation pathway. Depending on your region and the exact results, confirmation may include:
- Specialist referral  
- Sometimes endoscopy (a camera test) to examine and sample the small intestine  
- Sometimes a no-biopsy confirmation pathway in selected children (program-dependent)

### What tests are usually not needed
- Broad “everything” testing when symptoms and risk factors clearly point toward a celiac blood test first  
- Removing gluten as a “test” before proper testing

### What results might mean (simple interpretation)
- **Negative tests while eating gluten:** celiac less likely (but your clinician will interpret in context)  
- **Positive tests:** higher likelihood; confirmation pathway is important before lifelong treatment  
- **IgA-related issues:** may require different antibody tests (your clinician will guide this)

---

## 🧰 Treatment options

### First-line treatment
> ✅ The treatment is a **strict gluten-free diet**.

This allows the intestine to heal and helps symptoms and growth improve.

### If not improving (next steps)
- Dietitian review (hidden gluten and cross-contamination are common)  
- Check nutrient status (iron, vitamin D, etc.) and replace if needed  
- Review for other causes if symptoms persist despite confirmed strict diet (your clinician will guide this)

### Severe cases (hospital care)
- Significant dehydration, severe vomiting  
- Severe anemia symptoms (very weak, fainting)  
- Child looks very unwell

### Practical “how to do gluten-free” (parent-friendly essentials)
- Learn where gluten is found: wheat, barley, rye (and foods made from them)  
- Read labels every time (ingredients can change)  
- Prevent cross-contamination: separate toaster, separate cutting board, clean surfaces, avoid flour dust  
- School plan: safe lunch/snacks, teacher awareness, clear rules about food sharing  
- Consider vitamins/minerals if advised (iron, vitamin D, calcium; sometimes others)

---

## ⏳ Expected course & prognosis

### Typical timeline
- Many children feel better within weeks after strict gluten-free diet begins  
- Energy and stool patterns improve gradually  
- Growth catch-up can take months, especially if diagnosis was delayed  
- Blood tests used for monitoring improve over time (timeline varies)

### What “getting better” looks like
- Improved energy and appetite  
- Better stool consistency  
- Less belly pain/bloating  
- Growth curve improves

### What “getting worse” looks like
- Continued weight loss, ongoing severe symptoms  
- Persistent anemia or fatigue despite strict diet  
- Ongoing vomiting, dehydration, or blood in stool

### Return to school/daycare/sports guidance
- Return as soon as your child is hydrated and feels well  
- Provide a gluten-free plan for school meals/snacks and celebrations

---

## ⚠️ Complications (brief but clear)

### Common complications (if untreated)
- Iron deficiency anemia  
- Poor growth or delayed puberty  
- Low bone mineral density (vitamin D/calcium issues)

### Rare serious complications
- Severe malnutrition (uncommon but important)  
- Persistent symptoms despite strict diet requires reassessment (cross-contamination or alternate diagnoses)

---

## 🛡️ Prevention and reducing future episodes

Celiac disease itself is not “preventable,” but you can prevent symptoms and complications by:
- Diagnosing correctly (testing while still eating gluten)  
- Strict gluten-free diet once confirmed  
- Ongoing follow-up and nutrition monitoring  
- Teaching family and caregivers about cross-contamination

---

## 🌟 Special situations

### Infants
- Symptoms can be subtle (poor growth, irritability, diarrhea/constipation).  
- Any dehydration, persistent vomiting, or failure to thrive needs prompt assessment.

### Teens
- Watch for fatigue, headaches, delayed puberty, low iron, and hidden dietary restriction.  
- Support social eating situations (school, friends) with practical planning.

### Kids with chronic conditions (type 1 diabetes, thyroid disease, immunosuppression)
- Higher risk groups should have a low threshold for testing if symptoms appear.  
- Coordinate diet changes with the care team so nutrition stays balanced.

### Neurodevelopmental differences/autism
- Keep food changes structured and predictable.  
- Work with a dietitian to avoid unnecessary restriction and maintain adequate nutrition.

### Travel considerations
- Pack gluten-free snacks  
- Learn local label terms and cross-contamination risks  
- Consider a travel card explaining “gluten-free required” in the local language

### School/daycare notes (what teachers should know)
- Gluten-free diet is medical and strict  
- Avoid food sharing  
- Clear plan for snacks, celebrations, and crafts that use flour

---

## 📅 Follow-up plan

- Follow up with your clinician and dietitian after diagnosis to:  
  - Monitor growth and symptoms  
  - Re-check key labs (iron, vitamin D, and others as advised)  
  - Repeat celiac antibodies over time to confirm improvement  
- Seek earlier follow-up if:  
  - Symptoms persist despite strict diet  
  - Your child is losing weight or becoming very fatigued  
  - You suspect ongoing gluten exposure

---

## ❓ Parent FAQs

### “Is it contagious?”
No. Celiac disease is not an infection.

### “Can my child eat ___?”
If diagnosed, foods must be gluten-free. Many naturally gluten-free foods are safe (fruit, vegetables, meat, fish, eggs, beans, rice, potatoes) as long as there is no gluten contamination.

### “Can they bathe/swim/exercise?”
Yes. Activity is encouraged once your child feels well and nutrition is improving.

### “Will they outgrow it?”
Celiac disease is lifelong, but most children do extremely well with a strict gluten-free diet.

### “When can we stop treatment?”
The gluten-free diet is lifelong once celiac disease is confirmed.

## 🧡 Safety disclaimer (short, not scary)

This guide supports—not replaces—medical advice. If you are worried about your child, trust your instincts and seek urgent medical assessment.

---

<details>
<summary><strong>Optional: For clinicians (testing and follow-up pearls)</strong></summary>

### First-line testing strategy
- Order **tTG-IgA** and **total IgA** (avoid missing IgA deficiency).
- If IgA deficient: use **tTG-IgG** (± deamidated gliadin peptide IgG per local pathway).

### Pre-test conditions
- Ensure ongoing gluten intake before serology.
- Avoid starting gluten-free diet pre-confirmation unless medically required.

### Interpreting positive serology
- Positive tTG with compatible presentation increases suspicion.
- Confirm using your program’s pathway (biopsy vs no-biopsy pathway in selected pediatric cases, per local protocols).

### Baseline labs after diagnosis (practical set)
- Complete blood count, ferritin/iron studies
- Alanine aminotransferase
- Vitamin D
- Consider folate, vitamin B12, calcium intake assessment
- Consider thyroid screening depending on autoimmune risk

### Follow-up
- Symptom response + growth
- Serologic downtrend over time (timeline varies)
- If tTG remains elevated: diet review (cross-contamination common); consider alternate diagnoses if adherence confirmed.

### When to refer urgently / reassess
- Significant weight loss, dehydration, severe anemia
- Persistent symptoms despite confirmed strict gluten-free diet
- Concern for alternative diagnoses or complications
