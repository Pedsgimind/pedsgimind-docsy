Constipation is one of the most common pediatric GI problems — and one of the most misunderstood. Many children suffer for months because families try “more fiber” alone, or stop treatment too early.

## Red flags (seek medical assessment urgently)
- Vomiting with belly swelling
- Severe pain with fever
- Blood in stool with significant illness
- Poor growth, weight loss, persistent diarrhea
- Constipation starting in early infancy with severe symptoms

## Myth 1: “My child stools every day so it’s not constipation”
**Evidence:** Children can stool daily and still be constipated if stools are hard, incomplete, painful, or there is withholding/soiling.

## Myth 2: “It’s just behavioral”
**Evidence:** Withholding often begins after pain. Stool builds up, the rectum stretches, and children may lose normal sensation (soiling/overflow can happen).

## Myth 3: “More fiber fixes it”
**Evidence:** Fiber helps, but many children need a **structured plan** including stool softening to break the cycle. Fiber without softening can worsen pain.

## Myth 4: “Laxatives are dangerous or addictive”
**Evidence:** Common stool softeners used under guidance are widely used in pediatrics. The biggest risk is **undertreating** and stopping too soon.

## What actually works (a practical plan)
### 1) Make stools soft (key goal)
Aim for soft stools that pass without pain. Many kids need medication support for a period (your clinician will guide dosing and duration).

### 2) Routine toileting
- Sit 5–10 minutes after meals (gastrocolic reflex)
- Feet supported (stool under feet)
- Calm, no pressure

### 3) Fix diet and drinks
- Water routinely
- Fruits/vegetables/whole grains
- Limit excess milk/juice if it’s crowding out meals

### 4) Treat long enough
A common reason for failure is stopping as soon as things improve. The rectum needs time to recover.

## When to see a specialist
- Severe constipation despite a good plan
- Soiling/encopresis persists
- Growth concerns or red flags
- Suspected underlying disease
