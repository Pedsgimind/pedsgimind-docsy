Abdominal pain is one of the most common reasons children visit a clinic or emergency department. The good news: **most cases are not dangerous**. The key is knowing **what to watch for** and how to respond calmly.

## 1) Go to urgent care NOW if any red flags
Seek urgent assessment if abdominal pain comes with:
- Child looks very unwell, very sleepy, or hard to wake
- **Severe pain** that is worsening or constant
- **Green (bilious) vomiting**, blood in vomit, or persistent vomiting
- **Black stool** or large amounts of blood in stool
- Swollen/hard belly, severe tenderness, or pain with walking/jumping
- Fever + worsening belly pain
- Testicular pain/swelling (can present as belly pain)
- Under 3 months old with significant irritability/pain
- Dehydration signs (very low urine, dry mouth, lethargy)

## 2) The most common cause: constipation (often missed)
Constipation can cause:
- Pain around the belly button or lower belly
- Pain before stooling, better after stooling
- Hard/large stools, painful stooling
- Soiling/“skid marks” (overflow)
- “Daily stool” but still hard or incomplete (daily does not rule it out)

**If constipation is likely** and no red flags:
- Increase water
- Toileting routine after meals (5–10 minutes; feet supported)
- Increase fiber gradually
- Discuss stool softening therapy with your clinician (often needed for weeks–months)

## 3) Other common causes by age
### Toddlers (1–4 years)
- Constipation, viral illness, gas/bloating
- UTI (sometimes vomiting/fever without urinary symptoms)
- Less common but important: intussusception (episodes of severe pain), appendicitis

### School age (5–12 years)
- Constipation
- Functional abdominal pain (gut sensitivity / stress, often around belly button)
- Reflux/indigestion
- Celiac screening considered if symptoms persist or growth concerns

### Teens
- Constipation, reflux/gastritis, IBS
- Period-related pain
- Important: IBD if blood in stool, weight loss, chronic diarrhea

## 4) When to book a clinic visit (not emergency)
- Pain persists > 1–2 weeks
- Recurrent pain affecting school/sleep
- Poor appetite, weight loss, persistent nausea
- Ongoing constipation symptoms
- Blood in stool (especially mixed in stool)

## 5) What helps parents most
- Keep a brief diary: pain timing, stool pattern, triggers
- Treat constipation early if suspected
- Reassure your child and keep routines normal when safe
- Seek evaluation if recurrent or disruptive
