Celiac disease is an immune-mediated condition triggered by gluten exposure in genetically susceptible individuals. In children, it can present in classic ways (diarrhea, poor growth), but just as often it shows up with **non-classic** symptoms like anemia, constipation, fatigue, or subtle growth faltering.

This post is a practical, clinic-ready approach to **when to suspect celiac**, **how to test correctly**, and **what to do after diagnosis**.

---

## When to suspect celiac disease
### Classic (malabsorption) symptoms
- Chronic diarrhea or loose stools
- Abdominal distension, poor appetite
- Weight loss or poor weight gain
- Growth failure

### Common non-classic presentations (very frequent)
- Iron deficiency anemia (with or without low ferritin)
- Constipation, bloating, recurrent abdominal pain
- Chronic fatigue, irritability, “brain fog”
- Short stature or delayed puberty
- Recurrent aphthous ulcers
- Elevated liver enzymes (mild hypertransaminasemia)
- Dental enamel defects
- Low bone mineral density, fractures with minimal trauma

### High-risk groups (test even if minimally symptomatic)
- First-degree relative with celiac disease
- Type 1 diabetes mellitus
- Autoimmune thyroid disease
- Down syndrome, Turner syndrome
- Selective immunoglobulin A deficiency
- Unexplained iron deficiency anemia
- Persistent abnormal liver enzymes without another cause

---

## The most common testing mistake (and how to avoid it)
**Do not stop gluten before testing.**  
Serology and biopsy can normalize on a gluten-free diet and you may miss the diagnosis.

**Practical rule:** child should be eating gluten daily (for example, bread/pasta) for several weeks before testing, unless a clinician advises otherwise.

---

## First-line blood tests (best initial strategy)
Order:
- **Tissue transglutaminase immunoglobulin A (tTG-IgA)**
- **Total immunoglobulin A level (Total IgA)**

Why total IgA matters: if the child is IgA-deficient, the tTG-IgA may be falsely negative.

If total IgA is low (IgA deficiency), use IgG-based testing:
- **tTG-IgG** (and/or deamidated gliadin peptide IgG depending on local practice)

---

## What if the tTG-IgA is positive?
A positive test strongly suggests celiac disease, but **confirmation is essential**.

### Next steps
- Refer to Pediatric Gastroenterology (if not already involved)
- Confirm with small bowel evaluation based on local guideline approach and clinical context

### Very high tTG titers
In many pediatric pathways, very high titers (for example, markedly elevated above the lab’s upper limit) can support a simplified diagnostic pathway **in carefully selected children**, but this should be clinician-guided and program-dependent.

---

## Do not start a gluten-free diet until diagnosis is confirmed
Starting gluten-free early can:
- Make confirmation harder
- Lead to unnecessary lifelong restriction if the diagnosis is wrong
- Delay identifying alternative diagnoses

If symptoms are severe, this is a shared decision with your clinician.

---

## After diagnosis: what care should include
### Gluten-free diet (GFD)
The cornerstone of treatment:
- Strict lifelong gluten avoidance
- Cross-contamination education (toasters, shared spreads, cutting boards)
- Label reading skills (especially for families)

A pediatric dietitian is extremely helpful early.

### Nutritional assessment and common deficiencies
Check and replete as needed:
- Iron studies
- Vitamin D
- Folate and vitamin B12
- Calcium intake
- Consider zinc and other micronutrients depending on nutrition history

### Growth and puberty tracking
- Plot weight, height, body mass index over time
- Monitor pubertal development and catch-up growth

### Follow-up serology
tTG usually decreases with good adherence, but timeline varies. Persistent elevation suggests:
- Hidden gluten exposure
- Cross-contamination
- Poor adherence (often unintentional)
- Alternative/additional diagnoses

---

## Red flags: when to reassess the diagnosis or look for complications
If symptoms persist or worsen despite a gluten-free diet:
- Confirm diagnosis and original testing pathway
- Review diet in detail with a skilled dietitian
- Consider:
  - Lactose intolerance (temporary)
  - Functional abdominal pain
  - Constipation
  - Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (selected cases)
  - Inflammatory bowel disease (if red flags: blood, weight loss, nocturnal symptoms)

---

## A quick parent-friendly summary
If your child has celiac disease:
- Gluten triggers inflammation in the gut
- A strict gluten-free diet allows healing
- Most children feel better and grow well once treated
- Testing must be done while eating gluten
