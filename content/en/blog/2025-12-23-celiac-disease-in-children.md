Celiac disease is a condition where **gluten** (found in wheat, barley, and rye) triggers an immune reaction that damages the small intestine. In children, this can affect growth, energy, and nutrient absorption—sometimes with obvious symptoms, and sometimes very subtle ones.

The good news: once diagnosed and treated with a gluten-free diet, **most children do extremely well**.

## For families: when to suspect celiac disease
Celiac can look like many things.

### More “classic” symptoms
- Chronic diarrhea or loose stools
- Poor weight gain or weight loss
- Belly bloating, decreased appetite
- Fatigue and irritability

### Very common “non-classic” symptoms
- Iron deficiency anemia (often the first clue)
- Constipation, recurrent abdominal pain, bloating
- Slow growth or short stature
- Delayed puberty
- Mouth ulcers
- Mildly elevated liver enzymes
- Bone pains or fractures with minimal trauma

### Who should be tested even if symptoms are mild?
- First-degree relative with celiac disease
- Type 1 diabetes
- Autoimmune thyroid disease
- Down syndrome or Turner syndrome
- Selective immunoglobulin A deficiency

---

## The biggest testing rule (don’t skip this)
**Do not stop gluten before testing.**  
If gluten is removed too early, blood tests (and biopsies) can become normal and the diagnosis may be missed.

---

## How celiac disease is treated
Treatment is a **strict gluten-free diet**. This allows the intestine to heal and helps symptoms and growth improve.

Most children also need:
- Nutrition review (iron, vitamin D, calcium, and more)
- Follow-up visits and repeat bloodwork to ensure healing and adherence

---

> **Quick takeaway (for families):**  
> If you suspect celiac, **keep gluten in the diet until testing is complete**, and speak with your clinician about the right blood tests.

# For clinicians
## Testing strategy (first line)
Order:
- **tTG-IgA**
- **Total IgA**

If IgA deficient:
- **tTG-IgG** (± deamidated gliadin peptide IgG depending on local pathway)

**Pitfall:** ordering tTG-IgA without total IgA.

## Pretest conditions
- Ensure ongoing gluten intake before serology.
- Avoid starting gluten-free diet pre-confirmation unless medically required.

## Interpreting positive serology
- Positive tTG with compatible presentation = high suspicion.
- Confirm diagnosis using your program’s pathway (endoscopy/biopsy vs no-biopsy pathway in selected pediatric cases).

## Baseline labs after diagnosis (practical set)
- Complete blood count, ferritin/iron studies
- Alanine aminotransferase
- Vitamin D
- Consider folate, vitamin B12, calcium intake assessment
- Consider thyroid screening in context of autoimmune risk

## Follow-up
- Symptom response + growth
- Serologic downtrend over time (timeline varies)
- If tTG remains elevated: diet review (cross-contamination is common), consider alternate diagnoses if adherence is confirmed.

## When to refer urgently / reassess
- Significant weight loss, dehydration, severe anemia
- Persistent symptoms despite confirmed strict gluten-free diet
- Concern for alternative diagnoses or complications
