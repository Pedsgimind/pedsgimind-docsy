## 2) 🧠 What it is (plain language)

An ultrasound machine sends **high-frequency sound waves** into the body.

These sound waves:
- bounce off organs
- return to the probe
- are turned into images on a screen

Your child:
- lies on a bed
- has warm gel placed on the belly
- feels gentle pressure from the probe

### What part of the body is involved? (small diagram required)

### Common myths vs facts
- **Myth:** “Ultrasound uses radiation.”  
  **Fact:** It uses sound waves only.
- **Myth:** “It will hurt.”  
  **Fact:** It is painless; pressure may feel ticklish.
- **Myth:** “A normal ultrasound means nothing is wrong.”  
  **Fact:** It rules out many problems and helps guide next steps.

## 5) 🏠 Preparation & what helps (step-by-step)

> ✅ Preparation depends on **what the ultrasound is looking for**.

### Before the ultrasound
> ✅ **Do this now:**
- Ask if your child needs to **fast**:

    - Older children: 4–8 hours (varies)
- Dress your child in loose clothing
- Bring comfort items (toy, book, tablet)

### During the test
- your child lies still
- gel may feel cold
- probe moves over the belly
- test usually takes **15–30 minutes**

### Comfort tips
- Explain in simple words: “It’s like taking pictures with sound.”
- Distraction helps (videos, songs).
- Parents can usually stay with the child.

---

## 6) ⛔ What NOT to do (common mistakes)

- Don’t ignore fasting instructions.
- Don’t worry if the technician doesn’t explain results (they usually can’t).
- Don’t assume ultrasound finds everything—some conditions need other tests.

## 7) 🚦 When to worry: triage guidance

### 🔴 Call 911 / Emergency now
- severe abdominal pain with collapse
- trouble breathing
- severe lethargy

### 🟠 Same-day urgent visit
- worsening belly pain with fever
- persistent vomiting
- green or bloody vomit
- jaundice with unwell appearance

### 🟡 Book a routine appointment

---

## 8) 🩺 How doctors use the results (what to expect)

### What the ultrasound can show
- liver size and texture
- gallstones or bile duct dilation
- kidney size and swelling
- fluid collections
- masses or cysts
- bowel findings (selected conditions)
- blood flow (with Doppler)

### What it may NOT show well
- subtle bowel inflammation
- functional problems (like IBS)
- microscopic disease

### What happens next
- normal result → reassurance or other testing if needed
- abnormal result → targeted next steps (labs, referral, or treatment)

---

## 9) 🧰 Treatment decisions based on ultrasound

> ✅ Ultrasound **guides** treatment but is not a treatment itself.

### Examples
- gallstones → dietary changes, medications, or surgery consult
- enlarged liver → blood tests and specialist referral
- kidney swelling → urine tests and urology/nephrology follow-up
- fluid or mass → further imaging or referral

---

## 10) ⏳ Expected course & timeline

- Test itself is quick.
- Results are usually available the **same day or within a few days**.
- Next steps depend on findings and symptoms.

---

## 11) ⚠️ Risks & complications (brief)

- Ultrasound is **very safe**.
- No radiation.
