# 🤮💧 Acute Gastroenteritis in Children (Stomach Bug): Home Care + Red Flags

> ✅ Most “stomach bugs” are caused by viruses and improve in a few days.  
> Your main job is **hydration**, **watching for dehydration**, and **knowing when to seek help**.

---

## 1) 🧾 Quick “At-a-glance” box (top of page)

> ✅ **Condition name:** Acute Gastroenteritis  
> **Common names:** Stomach bug, viral gastro, vomiting/diarrhea illness, “food poisoning” (sometimes)  
>
> **Plain-language summary (2–3 lines):**  
> Acute gastroenteritis is inflammation of the stomach and intestines that causes vomiting and/or diarrhea. It is most often viral and spreads easily. Most children recover with supportive care—especially frequent small sips of fluid.
>
> **Who it affects (typical ages):**  
> All ages; dehydration risk is higher in **infants and toddlers**.
>
> ✅ **What parents should do today:**  
> - Start **oral rehydration** right away (small sips often).  
> - Keep your child **urinating regularly** (best sign of hydration).  
> - Continue breastfeeding/formula in infants if tolerated.  
> - Reintroduce food gradually when ready (small bland meals).  
>
> ⚠️ **Red flags that need urgent/ER care:**  
> - Signs of dehydration (no urine 8–12 hours, very sleepy, dizzy, dry mouth)  
> - Vomiting green (bilious), vomiting blood, or black “coffee-ground” vomit  
> - Bloody diarrhea or severe belly pain with a hard/swollen abdomen  
> - Persistent vomiting unable to keep fluids down  
> - Severe weakness, confusion, or fast breathing  
> - Fever in a baby **under 3 months**
>
> 🟡 **When to see the family doctor/clinic:**  
> - Symptoms lasting > 1 week  
> - Frequent recurring episodes  
> - Weight loss, poor growth, ongoing abdominal pain  
> - Diarrhea > 7–10 days, or blood/mucus in stool  
> - Recent antibiotic use (possible C. difficile)

## 2) 🧠 What it is (plain language)

Acute gastroenteritis is when the gut lining gets irritated, leading to:
- **vomiting** (stomach tries to empty),
- **diarrhea** (intestines push fluid out quickly),
- belly cramps, and sometimes fever.

### What part of the body is involved? (small diagram required)

<!-- AI IMAGE PROMPT: Friendly diagram showing stomach and intestines with simple labels: “virus,” “inflammation,” “vomiting,” “diarrhea,” and “fluid loss.” Include a simple dehydration gauge icon. Not scary. -->

### Myths vs facts
- **Myth:** “Diarrhea must be stopped immediately.”  
  **Fact:** The body is clearing the infection. Focus on hydration.
- **Myth:** “Kids should not eat at all.”  
  **Fact:** Fluids first; once vomiting improves, small foods help recovery.
- **Myth:** “Only spoiled food causes this.”  
  **Fact:** Viruses are the most common cause, especially in children.

## 3) 🧩 Why it happens (causes & triggers)

### Common causes
- **Viruses:** norovirus, rotavirus, adenovirus (common in daycare/schools)  
- **Bacteria:** sometimes from undercooked food, contaminated water, travel  
- **Parasites:** less common; consider with prolonged diarrhea or travel

### Less common but important causes (brief)
- Appendicitis (vomiting + worsening localized pain)
- UTI (especially in young children with fever/vomiting)
- Intussusception (episodic severe pain, lethargy, sometimes bloody stool)
- Diabetic ketoacidosis (teens: vomiting + dehydration + heavy breathing)

### Triggers that worsen symptoms
- Large amounts of juice/sugary drinks (can worsen diarrhea)
- Greasy foods early
- Dehydration (makes nausea worse)

### Risk factors
- Young age (higher dehydration risk)
- Daycare exposure
- Recent travel
- Household contact with vomiting illness

---

## 4) 👀 What parents might notice (symptoms)

### Typical symptoms (most common first)
- Vomiting (often first 24 hours)
- Diarrhea (watery stools)
- Belly cramps
- Mild fever
- Reduced appetite, fatigue

### Symptoms by age group
- **Infants:** poor feeding, fewer wet diapers, sleepier than usual  
- **Toddlers:** vomiting, diarrhea, refusing fluids, cranky  
- **School-age:** abdominal cramps, diarrhea, can often describe dizziness  
- **Teens:** watch for severe dehydration and other diagnoses (migraine, DKA)

### What’s normal vs what’s not normal
✅ **Often normal:** mild fever, watery diarrhea, improving daily, drinking some fluids  
⚠️ **Not normal:** blood in stool, green vomiting, severe persistent pain, dehydration signs, very sleepy/hard to wake

### Symptom tracker
- Number of vomits and stools/day
- Stool appearance (blood? mucus?)
- Fluid intake amount
- Urination frequency
- Fever (temperature)
- Energy level

---

## 5) 🏠 Home care and what helps (step-by-step)

### ✅ What to do in the first 24–48 hours (most important section)

### Step 1: Hydration plan (tiny sips often)
> ✅ **Do this now:**  
> - Use **oral rehydration solution (ORS)** if available.  
> - Give **5–10 mL (1–2 teaspoons) every 2–3 minutes** for young kids.  
> - For older kids: small sips every few minutes.  
> - If vomiting happens, **wait 5–10 minutes**, then restart with smaller sips.

**Best sign you’re winning:** your child is **peeing** regularly.

### Step 2: Feeding plan
- **Breastfed infants:** continue breastfeeding (short frequent feeds)
- **Formula-fed infants:** continue formula in smaller amounts if tolerated
- **Older kids:** once vomiting slows, offer small bland foods:
  - toast, crackers, rice, banana, soup, yogurt if tolerated

### Step 3: What drinks to avoid early
- Juice, pop, sports drinks (too much sugar can worsen diarrhea)
- Very concentrated homemade drinks (incorrect salt/sugar ratio)

### Step 4: Comfort measures
- Rest, cool room, quiet environment
- Clean skin barrier for diaper rash (zinc oxide)

### What usually makes it worse
- Big drinks all at once
- Greasy foods early
- Trying to “force” food when nauseated

---

## 6) ⛔ What NOT to do (common mistakes)

### Unsafe treatments parents commonly try
- Anti-diarrhea medications without clinician advice (especially in young kids)
- Antibiotics “just in case” (not usually needed and sometimes harmful)
- Home-made salt solutions without reliable recipe (risk of electrolyte imbalance)

### “Avoid unless your clinician told you”
- Bismuth subsalicylate in children without guidance
- Multiple supplements/herbals for diarrhea

### OTC medication cautions
- Fever/pain: use age-appropriate dosing only (ask clinician if unsure)
- Avoid ibuprofen if dehydrated or vomiting a lot (can irritate stomach and kidneys)

---

## 7) 🚦 When to worry: triage guidance

### 🔴 Call 911 / Emergency now
- Severe trouble breathing, turning blue, fainting
- Signs of shock: very weak, cold clammy skin, very hard to wake

**Example:** “My child is barely responsive and breathing fast.”

### 🟠 Same-day urgent visit
- **Dehydration:** no urine 8–12 hours, very dry mouth, sunken eyes, dizzy  
- Persistent vomiting and cannot keep any fluids down  
- **Green vomit**, blood in vomit, black vomit  
- **Bloody diarrhea** or severe belly pain with hard belly  
- Fever in baby **<3 months**

**Example:** “Vomiting every time they sip and no pee since morning.”

### 🟡 Book a routine appointment
- Diarrhea lasting > 7–10 days
- Recurrent episodes or weight loss
- Blood/mucus persists in stool
- Recent antibiotics (evaluate for C. difficile)
- Concern for food intolerance or chronic GI disorder

**Example:** “Diarrhea keeps coming back every month.”

### 🟢 Watch at home
- Child is drinking some fluids, peeing, and improving day by day
- No red flags

---

## 8) 🩺 How doctors diagnose it (what to expect)

### What the clinician will ask
- Duration and pattern of vomiting/diarrhea
- Exposure history (daycare, travel, sick contacts)
- Hydration status (urine output)
- Blood/mucus in stool
- Medications (especially antibiotics)

### Physical exam basics
- Hydration check (mouth, tears, eyes, heart rate)
- Abdominal exam

### Possible tests (and why)
- Stool tests if: blood, severe illness, prolonged diarrhea, travel, outbreaks
- Blood tests if: dehydration/severe illness
- Urine test if fever/vomiting and UTI concern

### What tests are usually not needed
- Viral gastroenteritis usually diagnosed clinically—no tests needed if mild and improving

### What results might mean
- Viral: supportive care
- Bacterial: may require targeted treatment in select cases
- Dehydration: fluids and monitoring

---

## 9) 🧰 Treatment options

### First-line treatment
- ORS hydration strategy
- Continue breastfeeding/formula
- Gradual return to food
- Barrier cream for diaper rash

### If not improving (next steps)
- Medical review for dehydration, persistent vomiting, blood in stool
- Consider antiemetic (example: ondansetron) **clinician-directed** if vomiting prevents hydration
- Stool testing if severe/prolonged or blood present

### Severe cases (hospital care)
- IV fluids
- Electrolyte monitoring
- Evaluation for obstruction/appendicitis/intussusception if suspected

#### Medication/treatment details (key ones)
**Oral rehydration solution**
- What it does: replaces water + salts
- How to give: tiny sips frequently
- Side effects: none if used correctly

**Ondansetron (clinician-directed)**
- What it does: reduces vomiting to allow hydration
- How to give: as prescribed
- Common side effects: constipation, headache
- Serious side effects (rare): rhythm issues in specific risk situations
- When to stop/seek help: fainting, severe dizziness, allergic reaction
- Interactions: discuss heart conditions or QT-prolonging medicines

---

## 10) ⏳ Expected course & prognosis

- Vomiting often improves in **24–48 hours**
- Diarrhea may last **3–7 days** (sometimes a bit longer)
- “Getting better” looks like:
  - more urination
  - improved energy
  - fewer vomits
  - diarrhea becoming less frequent
- “Getting worse” looks like:
  - fewer wet diapers/urine
  - persistent vomiting
  - new blood in stool
  - increasing abdominal pain

### Return to school/daycare/sports
- Return when:
  - vomiting has stopped,
  - fever-free,
  - drinking well and peeing,
  - energy improved.
- Follow local daycare/school illness policies.

---

## 11) ⚠️ Complications (brief but clear)

### Common complications
- Dehydration
- Temporary lactose intolerance after infection (loose stools with dairy for a short time)
- Diaper rash

### Rare serious complications
- Severe dehydration/electrolyte imbalance
- Bacterial complications (rare)
- Misdiagnosis of appendicitis/obstruction (watch red flags)

---

## 12) 🛡️ Prevention and reducing future episodes

- Handwashing (best prevention)
- Disinfect surfaces during outbreaks
- Avoid sharing cups/utensils
- Safe food handling (cook meats properly)
- Vaccines: rotavirus vaccine helps prevent severe infant gastroenteritis where part of routine schedule

---

## 13) 🌟 Special situations

### Infants
- Lower threshold for dehydration and evaluation
- Fever under 3 months needs prompt medical assessment

### Teens
- Consider other diagnoses if severe vomiting/dehydration (migraine, DKA)

### Kids with chronic conditions (asthma, diabetes, immunosuppression)
- Lower threshold for medical review
- Diabetes: check for ketones if vomiting and dehydration

### Neurodevelopmental differences/autism
- Use preferred cups/straws, visual schedules for sipping
- Monitor dehydration closely

### Travel considerations
- Carry ORS packets
- Avoid unsafe water/ice in high-risk areas

### School/daycare notes
- Encourage hydration access and bathroom breaks
- Strict hand hygiene after diarrhea

---

## 14) 📅 Follow-up plan

- Follow up if:
  - symptoms persist > 7–10 days
  - diarrhea is bloody
  - weight loss or poor growth
  - recurrent episodes
- Bring:
  - stool/vomit diary, photos if blood present
  - urine count
  - medication list

---

## 15) ❓ Parent FAQs

### “Is it contagious?”
Often yes—viral gastroenteritis spreads easily. Keep good hand hygiene and avoid sharing utensils.

### “Can my child eat ___?”
Once vomiting improves, small bland foods are fine. Avoid greasy foods early. If diarrhea worsens with dairy, consider a short break and reintroduce slowly.

### “Can they bathe/swim/exercise?”
Baths are fine. Avoid swimming until diarrhea has stopped (to prevent spreading germs).

### “Will they outgrow it?”
Yes—most viral gastroenteritis resolves fully. Recurrent episodes may need evaluation.

### “When can we stop treatment?”
When your child is drinking normally, peeing normally, and symptoms have resolved.
