## 2) 🧠 What it is (plain language)

**Nausea** is a feeling of “I might throw up.”  
It comes from signals between:
- the stomach and intestines,
- the brain (vomiting center),
- the balance system (inner ear),
- and the nervous system (stress response).

### Common myths vs facts
- **Myth:** “If my child is nauseated, they must have food poisoning.”  
  **Fact:** Many causes exist—viral illness, constipation, anxiety, reflux, migraine, motion sickness.
- **Myth:** “They should stop eating completely.”  
  **Fact:** Fluids first, then small bland foods can help once tolerated.
- **Myth:** “If there’s no vomiting, it’s not real.”  
  **Fact:** Nausea can be very real even without vomiting.

## 3) 🧩 Why it happens (causes & triggers)

### Common causes (most likely)
- **Viral gastroenteritis** (often with vomiting/diarrhea)  
- **Constipation** (can cause nausea even without obvious belly pain)  
- **Motion sickness** (car rides, screens in the car)  
- **Anxiety / stress** (school mornings, tests)  
- **Reflux** (heartburn, sour taste, throat symptoms)  
- **Overeating or skipping meals** (empty stomach nausea is common)

### Less common but important causes (brief)
- Appendicitis (worsening pain, fever, localized tenderness)
- Bowel obstruction (green vomit, swollen belly, severe pain)
- Migraine (nausea with headache/light sensitivity)
- Kidney infection/UTI (fever, pain with urination)
- Medication side effects (antibiotics, iron, some ADHD meds)
- Pregnancy (in teens of reproductive age—must be considered clinically)

### Triggers that worsen nausea
- Strong smells, heat, car rides
- Greasy/spicy foods
- Dehydration
- Anxiety and hyperventilation
- Constipation untreated

### Risk factors
- Family history of migraine/IBS/anxiety
- Prior episodes of motion sickness
- Chronic constipation
- Irregular sleep and meals

---

## 4) 👀 What parents might notice (symptoms)

### Typical symptoms (most common first)
- “My tummy feels yucky,” queasy feeling
- Less appetite
- Gagging, retching
- Increased saliva
- Pale, tired, “not themselves”
- Sometimes vomiting or diarrhea

### Symptoms by age group
- **Infant:** poor feeding, fussiness, gagging/spit-up, fewer wet diapers  
- **Toddler:** refuses food, holds tummy, may vomit  
- **School-age:** nausea before school, motion triggers, constipation-related nausea  
- **Teen:** stress-related nausea, reflux, migraine, medication-related patterns

### What’s normal vs what’s not normal
✅ **Often okay to watch at home:** mild nausea, child alert, drinking, urinating, improving  
⚠️ **Needs medical review:** dehydration, severe pain, green/bloody vomit, severe headache/neck stiffness, weight loss, persistent symptoms

### Symptom trackers (what to write down)
- Timing: morning vs after meals vs car rides
- Vomiting: how many times, color (green/blood?)
- Stool pattern (constipation? diarrhea?)
- Fever, headache, dizziness
- Hydration: wet diapers/urine count
- Trigger notes: school, stress, foods, travel
- Medications/supplements started recently

---

## 5) 🏠 Home care and what helps (step-by-step)

### ✅ What to do in the first 24–48 hours
1) **Hydration first** (tiny sips often).  
2) **Rest** in a cool, quiet room.  
3) **Avoid heavy foods** until nausea settles.  
4) **Check constipation** (last stool? hard/painful? stool withholding?).  
5) **Use simple nausea tools** below.

### Hydration plan (the most important step)
> ✅ **Do this now:**  
> - Offer **5–10 mL (1–2 teaspoons) every 2–3 minutes** for young kids.  
> - For older kids: small frequent sips every few minutes.  
> - Oral rehydration solution is best if vomiting/diarrhea is present.

**Signs hydration is working:** more urine, more energy, moist mouth, tears when crying.

### Food plan (when your child is ready)
- Start with small bland foods:
  - toast, crackers, rice, banana, applesauce, soup, yogurt if tolerated
- Avoid:
  - greasy, spicy, very sugary foods
- **Don’t force eating**—fluids matter most early on.

### Practical routines (common helpful habits)
- Keep child upright after eating (helps reflux)
- Fresh air and slow walking can reduce nausea
- Warm bath may soothe (if no dehydration risk)

### Tools that can help nausea
- **Acupressure P6 point** (wrist nausea point)  
- **Ginger** (age-appropriate; avoid choking hazards)  
- **Peppermint tea** (older kids; not for infants)  
- **Breathing to stop “panic nausea”** (slow belly breathing)

### What usually makes it worse
- Big meals
- Lying flat right after eating
- Screens in the car (motion sickness)
- Skipping breakfast
- Constipation not addressed

---

## 6) ⛔ What NOT to do (common mistakes)

### Unsafe treatments parents commonly try
- Using anti-diarrhea medications without guidance
- Giving unregulated herbal remedies
- Forcing large volumes of fluids quickly (can trigger vomiting)

### “Avoid unless your clinician told you”
- Repeated use of “strong” anti-nausea medicines without evaluation
- Restrictive elimination diets for vague nausea (risk of poor nutrition)

### When not to give over-the-counter medications
- Avoid cold/flu products for nausea
- Avoid bismuth subsalicylate in kids unless clinician approves (age-related cautions)

---

## 7) 🚦 When to worry: triage guidance

### 🔴 Call 911 / Emergency now
- Trouble breathing, turning blue, fainting
- Severe confusion, seizure
- Severe weakness with signs of shock

**Example:** “My child is very sleepy and won’t wake normally.”

### 🟠 Same-day urgent visit
- **Cannot keep fluids down**, vomiting repeatedly
- **Dehydration:** no urine 8–12 hours, very dry mouth, dizzy, sunken eyes
- **Green vomit** (bilious) or blood/black vomit
- Severe belly pain or swollen/hard belly
- Severe headache with neck stiffness

**Example:** “Vomiting every hour and no pee since morning.”

### 🟡 Book a routine appointment
- Nausea lasting **> 1–2 weeks**
- Recurrent nausea (morning/school pattern)
- Weight loss, poor growth, persistent fatigue
- Suspected reflux, migraine, anxiety, or medication side effect

**Example:** “Nausea every school morning but fine on weekends.”

### 🟢 Watch at home
- Mild nausea, child drinking and urinating, improving day by day
- No red flags

**Example:** “Queasy after a viral cold, better with small sips and rest.”

## 8) 🩺 How doctors diagnose it (what to expect)

### What the clinician will ask
- Pattern: when it happens, triggers, morning vs after meals
- Vomiting details (color, frequency)
- Stool pattern and constipation history
- Fever, headache, dizziness
- Growth and weight changes
- Medication/supplement review
- In teens: confidential screening when appropriate

### Physical exam basics
- Hydration check, abdominal exam, vital signs
- Neurologic check if severe headache/concerns

### Possible tests (and why)
- Urine test if fever or UTI concern
- Blood work if dehydration, weight loss, persistent symptoms
- Stool tests if diarrhea/blood
- Imaging if appendicitis or obstruction is suspected

### What tests are usually not needed
- Scans for short-lived mild nausea that is improving and exam is reassuring

### What results might mean (simple interpretation)
- Normal tests + functional pattern suggests gut–brain triggers (constipation, anxiety, reflux)
- Abnormal findings guide targeted treatment

---

## 9) 🧰 Treatment options

### First-line treatment
- Hydration plan + rest
- Constipation management if present
- Trigger management (motion sickness strategies, regular meals)
- Reflux strategies if symptoms fit

### If not improving (next steps)
- Evaluate for constipation, reflux disease, migraine, anxiety
- Consider anti-nausea medication **only under clinician guidance** if vomiting prevents hydration
- Consider referral if persistent/recurrent (pediatric GI, neurology for migraine pattern, psychology for anxiety pattern)

### Severe cases (hospital care)
- IV fluids if dehydration
- Urgent evaluation for obstruction/appendicitis or other serious causes

#### Medication/treatment details (parent-friendly)
**Oral rehydration solution**
- What it does: replaces fluids and salts
- How to give: tiny sips frequently
- Side effects: none; too much too fast can cause vomiting
- When to stop/seek help: worsening dehydration

**Antiemetic (example: ondansetron) — clinician-directed**
- What it does: reduces vomiting so hydration is possible
- How to give: as prescribed; often single dose or short course
- Common side effects: constipation, headache
- Serious side effects (rare): heart rhythm issues in certain high-risk situations
- When to stop and seek help: severe dizziness, fainting, allergic reaction
- Interactions: tell clinician about heart conditions, electrolyte problems, QT-prolonging medications

**Constipation treatment**
- If constipation is present, treating it often improves nausea (see your constipation resources)

---

## 10) ⏳ Expected course & prognosis

### Typical timeline
- Viral nausea: often improves in **24–72 hours** (sometimes longer)
- Constipation-related nausea: improves over **days to 1–2 weeks** once stools soften and regularize
- Motion sickness: improves with prevention strategies
- Anxiety-related nausea: improves with skills practice over **weeks**

### What “getting better” looks like
- More urine, better energy
- Less queasiness, able to eat small meals
- Less vomiting and better sleep

### What “getting worse” looks like
- Less urine, more sleepiness
- Increasing pain, green/bloody vomit
- Cannot keep any fluids down

### Return to school/daycare/sports
- Return when:
  - drinking well,
  - fever-free,
  - energy is returning,
  - vomiting controlled.
- Start with light activity and small snacks.

---

## 11) ⚠️ Complications (brief but clear)

### Common complications
- Dehydration
- Constipation worsening after illness
- Temporary food avoidance

### Rare serious complications
- Obstruction/appendicitis/migraine emergencies (watch red flags)

---

## 12) 🛡️ Prevention and reducing future episodes

- Hand hygiene (for viral illnesses)
- Regular meals and hydration
- Constipation prevention plan
- Motion sickness prevention:
  - look out window, fresh air, avoid screens, light snack before travel
- Stress plan for school mornings: breathing + predictable routine

---

## 13) 🌟 Special situations

### Infants
- Feeding refusal, dehydration, fever in young infants requires prompt medical assessment.

### Teens
- Consider migraine, reflux, stress, medication effects
- Clinicians may consider pregnancy as part of routine medical evaluation when appropriate.

### Kids with chronic conditions (asthma, diabetes, immunosuppression)
- Lower threshold for evaluation and dehydration management.

### Neurodevelopmental differences/autism
- Use predictable hydration routine, preferred cups, visual schedules
- Monitor dehydration closely (some kids don’t communicate nausea well)

### Travel considerations
- Motion sickness plan + acupressure bands + snacks + hydration

### School/daycare notes
- Encourage water access and bathroom breaks
- Avoid sending child back too early if dehydration risk remains

---

## 14) 📅 Follow-up plan

- Follow up with your family doctor/pediatrician if:
  - symptoms persist > 1–2 weeks
  - recurrent nausea episodes
  - weight loss/poor growth
  - red flags occur
- Bring:
  - symptom diary (timing/triggers)
  - medication list
  - stool pattern notes

---

## 15) ❓ Parent FAQs

### “Is it contagious?”
Sometimes. Viral stomach bugs can spread easily. Nausea from constipation, reflux, migraine, or anxiety is **not contagious**.

### “Can my child eat ___?”
Usually yes, but start with small bland foods. Avoid greasy/spicy foods until improved. Don’t skip breakfast if morning nausea is a pattern.

### “Can they bathe/swim/exercise?”
Baths are fine if not dehydrated. Swimming/exercise is okay once hydration and energy are back.

### “Will they outgrow it?”
Depends on the cause. Viral nausea passes. Constipation/motion sickness/anxiety-related patterns improve with targeted strategies.

### “When can we stop treatment?”
Stop extra supports once your child is drinking/eating normally and symptoms are gone. Keep prevention routines (hydration, constipation prevention) if recurrent.
