## 2) 🧠 What nutrition means (plain language)

Nutrition includes:
- **Calories** for energy and growth  
- **Protein** for muscles, organs, and immunity  
- **Fats** for brain development and hormone health  
- **Carbohydrates** for fuel  
- **Vitamins & minerals** for bones, blood, nerves, and immunity  

Children’s needs change with **age, growth spurts, illness, and activity level**.

---

## 10) ⏳ Expected course & prognosis

Higher needs during growth spurts and sports.

### Chronic illness
May require tailored plans and higher calories.

### Neurodevelopmental differences/autism
Predictable routines and feeding therapy support.

### Travel
Plan snacks and regular meal times.

### School/daycare
Pack balanced snacks; avoid all-day grazing.

---

## 14) 📅 Follow-up plan

- review growth at routine visits  
- earlier follow-up if:

  - feeding stress escalates

---

## 15) ❓ Parent FAQs (Nutrition-Specific)

### “How do I know if my child is eating enough?”
Growth trend, energy, and development matter more than portion size.

### “Is picky eating a nutrition problem?”
Not if growth and energy are normal. It’s often developmental.

### “Should I give a multivitamin?”
Only if advised or intake is limited; food comes first.

### “How much milk is appropriate?”
Too much milk can reduce appetite and iron intake—ask for age-specific guidance.

### “When should I see a dietitian?”
If growth is affected, variety is very limited, or meals are stressful.
