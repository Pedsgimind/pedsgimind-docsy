# 🧒🟡🧬 Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis (PSC) in Children: A Parent-Friendly Guide

> ✅ **Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC)** is a condition where the body’s immune system causes **inflammation and scarring in the bile ducts** (the “drainage pipes” that carry bile from the liver to the intestine).  
> PSC often overlaps with **inflammatory bowel disease (especially ulcerative colitis)** and needs long-term monitoring.

---

## 1) 🧾 Quick “At-a-glance” box (top of page)

> ✅ **Condition name:** Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis  
> **Common names:** PSC, bile duct inflammation/scarring  
>
> **Plain-language summary (2–3 lines):**  
> PSC causes bile ducts to become inflamed and narrowed. This can reduce bile flow and irritate the liver over time. Many children feel well early, but regular follow-up is important because PSC can flare and can lead to complications in some cases.
>
> **Who it affects (typical ages):**  
> Can occur in **school-age children and teens**. Often diagnosed during workup for abnormal liver tests or in children with IBD.
>
> ✅ **What parents should do today:**  
> - Keep all hepatology and IBD follow-ups (if applicable)  
> - Ask which monitoring plan your child needs (blood tests, imaging, colonoscopy schedule)  
> - Watch for jaundice, itching, fevers, belly pain  
> - Ensure vaccines are up to date (especially hepatitis)
>
> ⚠️ **Red flags that need urgent/ER care:**  
> - High fever with chills and worsening right-upper belly pain (possible bile duct infection)  
> - Yellow eyes/skin worsening quickly  
> - Severe sleepiness/confusion  
> - Vomiting blood or black stools
>
> 🟡 **When to see the family doctor/clinic:**  
> - New itching, fatigue, or belly discomfort  
> - Recurrent fevers  
> - Abnormal liver tests  
> - New jaundice

## 2) 🧠 What it is (plain language)

Bile ducts are tubes that carry bile:
- from the liver
- through the bile ducts
- into the intestine to help digest fats

In PSC:
- bile ducts become inflamed
- scarring forms
- ducts can narrow (like a “pinched straw”)
- bile backs up and can irritate the liver

### What part of the body is involved? (small diagram required)

### Common myths vs facts
- **Myth:** “PSC is caused by diet.”  
  **Fact:** PSC is an immune-related disease; diet does not cause it.
- **Myth:** “If my child feels fine, PSC is not serious.”  
  **Fact:** PSC can be silent early; monitoring prevents missed complications.
- **Myth:** “PSC always leads to transplant.”  
  **Fact:** Some children remain stable for many years; outcomes vary.

## 3) 🧩 Why it happens (causes & triggers)

### Cause
- Immune-mediated inflammation of bile ducts (exact cause unknown)

### Strong associations
- inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), especially ulcerative colitis

### Triggers that can worsen symptoms (flares)
- infections
- inflammation activity (often overlaps with gut inflammation)
- bile duct blockage episodes

### Risk factors
- personal or family history of autoimmune disease
- IBD diagnosis

---

## 4) 👀 What parents might notice (symptoms)

Many children have few symptoms early.

### Possible symptoms
- fatigue
- itching
- intermittent belly discomfort
- jaundice (yellow eyes/skin)

### Symptoms of bile duct infection (urgent)
- fever + chills
- worsening right-upper belly pain
- jaundice worsening quickly
- vomiting or appearing very unwell

### What’s normal vs what’s not
✅ Stable PSC:
- child feels well
- labs stable with follow-up

⚠️ Concerning:
- fever/chills with pain
- worsening jaundice
- persistent itching disrupting sleep
- unintended weight loss

### Symptom tracker
- itching (none/mild/moderate/severe)
- fever episodes (date/temp)
- belly pain (where, how severe)
- stool changes (if IBD present)
- energy level

---

## 5) 🏠 Home care and what helps (step-by-step)

> ✅ PSC requires specialist follow-up; home care focuses on symptom management and early recognition.

### First 24–48 hours after diagnosis
> ✅ **Do this now:**
- Ask your specialist:
  - Does my child have large-duct PSC, small-duct PSC, or overlap?
  - Does my child need MRCP imaging?
  - What is the plan for IBD screening/monitoring?
  - How often are blood tests needed?
- Set up a fever plan:
  - “If fever + belly pain occurs, where do we go and who do we call?”

### Supportive care at home
- hydration and rest during minor illness
- itch care:
  - moisturize
  - cool room at night
  - keep nails short
- healthy nutrition (especially if IBD coexists)

---

## 6) ⛔ What NOT to do (common mistakes)

- Don’t ignore fever with belly pain (could be cholangitis).
- Don’t stop medications without guidance.
- Don’t start supplements/herbs without approval.
- Don’t skip monitoring visits even if symptoms are mild.

---

## 7) 🚦 When to worry: triage guidance

### 🔴 Call 911 / Emergency now
- severe weakness, confusion, collapse
- vomiting blood or black stools
- severe belly pain with signs of shock

### 🟠 Same-day urgent visit
- fever + chills + right-upper belly pain
- jaundice worsening quickly
- persistent vomiting or dehydration

**Example:** “Fever with chills and new yellow eyes.”

### 🟡 Book a routine appointment
- new itching
- gradual fatigue
- questions about imaging or lab trends
- mild abdominal discomfort

### 🟢 Watch at home
- stable child with known PSC and no new symptoms, following plan

---

## 8) 🩺 How doctors diagnose it (what to expect)

### What the clinician will ask
- symptoms (itching, fevers)
- bowel symptoms (IBD screening)
- medication history
- family autoimmune history

### Physical exam basics
- liver and spleen size
- signs of jaundice
- growth and nutrition status

### Possible tests (and why)
- blood tests:
  - liver enzymes (especially cholestatic pattern)
  - bilirubin
  - clotting and albumin
- MRCP (special MRI to map bile ducts)
- ultrasound
- autoimmune markers (supporting data)
- colonoscopy if IBD suspected or known PSC (team-directed)
- liver biopsy in selected cases

### What tests are usually not needed
- repeated imaging without a clinical reason
- biopsy if MRCP and clinical picture are clear (depends on case)

---

## 9) 🧰 Treatment options

> ✅ There is no single “cure” medicine for PSC, but treatments focus on symptoms, complications, and overlapping IBD.

### First-line management
- regular monitoring (labs + imaging)
- manage itching if present
- treat vitamin deficiencies if bile flow is reduced
- optimize IBD control if present

### If not improving / complications develop
- treat cholangitis (bile duct infection) urgently with antibiotics
- endoscopic procedures if strictures/narrowings need treatment
- specialist hepatology care escalation

### Severe cases (hospital care / transplant)
- progressive cirrhosis
- portal hypertension complications
- recurrent severe infections
- liver failure

#### Medication/treatment notes (parent-friendly)
- **Itch medicines:** reduce bile-related itching when needed  
- **Antibiotics:** for cholangitis (urgent)  
- **Endoscopy procedures:** may open narrowed ducts in some cases  
- **Transplant:** for advanced disease or complications

---

## 10) ⏳ Expected course & prognosis

- PSC is typically chronic and needs long-term follow-up.
- Some children remain stable for many years.
- Others may have progression and need advanced care.

### What “getting better” looks like
- stable labs
- fewer symptoms (itching, fatigue)
- fewer infections

### What “getting worse” looks like
- increasing jaundice
- recurrent fevers/cholangitis
- worsening scarring signs on imaging
- complications of portal hypertension

---

## 11) ⚠️ Complications (brief but clear)

### More common complications
- itching
- vitamin deficiencies (A, D, E, K)
- cholangitis (bile duct infection)

### Serious complications
- cirrhosis
- portal hypertension (enlarged spleen, varices)
- variceal bleeding
- liver failure

---

## 12) 🛡️ Prevention and reducing future problems

- keep vaccines up to date (especially hepatitis)
- avoid alcohol later in adolescence/adulthood
- avoid smoking/vaping exposure
- early evaluation of fevers
- strong IBD control when present
- consistent follow-up

---

## 13) 🌟 Special situations

### PSC with IBD
Common overlap:
- colon monitoring plans are important
- symptom tracking should include stool patterns and bleeding

### Teens
Adherence and mental health support matter; chronic conditions can be stressful.

### Kids with chronic conditions/immunosuppression
Lower threshold for evaluating fever.

### Neurodevelopmental differences/autism
Use visual medication schedules; caregiver-supervised routines.

### Travel considerations
Carry:
- medical summary
- medication list
- “fever + belly pain” emergency plan

### School/daycare notes
Allow clinic visits; notify parent if fever or severe abdominal pain occurs.

---

## 14) 📅 Follow-up plan

- regular hepatology follow-up
- scheduled liver blood tests
- periodic imaging (MRCP/ultrasound as advised)
- IBD monitoring and colon surveillance if applicable
- urgent plan for fever/pain episodes

---

## 15) ❓ Parent FAQs

### “Is it contagious?”
No.

### “Can my child eat ___?”
Usually yes. If IBD is present, diet may be individualized.

### “Can they bathe/swim/exercise?”
Yes, usually. Avoid contact sports if spleen is enlarged.

### “Will they outgrow it?”
PSC is chronic; many children do well with monitoring and care.

### “When can we stop treatment?”
Follow-up is long-term. Treatments may change over time; never stop medications without guidance.
