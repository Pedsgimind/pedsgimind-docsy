# 💪🧘 Progressive Muscle Relaxation (PMR) for Kids  
*A parent-friendly guide to relaxing the body to calm the gut*

---

> ✅ **What this is:** A step-by-step method where a child tightens and then relaxes muscle groups to teach the body the difference between “tense” and “relaxed.” This can reduce stress tummy and pain flares.

## 1) 🧾 Quick “At-a-glance” box (top of page)

> ✅ **Tool name:** Progressive Muscle Relaxation (PMR)  
> **Also called:** Tense-and-release relaxation, body scan relaxation  
>  
> **What it is (2–3 lines):** PMR helps kids relax their muscles and nervous system. When the body relaxes, the gut often becomes less “on edge,” which can ease functional abdominal pain, nausea, and stress symptoms.  
>  
> **Who it helps most:** Often **age 5–6+**, school-age, and teens.  
>  
> ✅ **What parents should do today:**  
> - Try the **5-minute PMR routine** below at bedtime.  
>  
> ⚠️ **Red flags:** severe belly pain with hard belly, repeated vomiting, blood in stool/vomit, dehydration, fainting, trouble breathing.  
>  
> 🟡 **When to see a clinic/doctor:** frequent symptoms, missed school, weight loss, poor growth, nighttime waking pain.

## 2) 🧠 What it is (plain language)

PMR teaches: “I can relax my body on purpose.”  
It’s like learning to **turn off** tight muscles that stay “on” during stress.

### Myths vs facts
- **Myth:** “Relaxation means ignoring pain.”  
  **Fact:** Relaxation reduces body tension that can amplify pain.
- **Myth:** “Kids can’t do this.”  
  **Fact:** Most kids can with a playful approach.

---

## 3) ?? Why it helps
Stress often causes:
- muscle guarding (including belly muscles)
- shallow breathing
- heightened pain signals

PMR reduces tension and helps the nervous system shift to calm mode.

---

## 4) 👀 What parents might notice
- clenched jaw/shoulders
- stomachaches at bedtime or before school
- frequent “I don’t feel good” with stress

Tracker: triggers, tension signs, pain score, skill used.

## 5) 🏠 Home care and what helps (step-by-step)

### ✅ First 24–48 hours
- Practice once daily when calm (bedtime is ideal)
- Keep it short and consistent

### 5-minute PMR routine (kid-friendly)
> ✅ **Do this now:**  
> 1) **Hands:** “Squeeze lemons” (tight fists) for 3 seconds → relax 6 seconds  
> 2) **Arms:** “Be strong like a statue” → relax  
> 3) **Shoulders:** “Shrug to your ears” → relax and drop  
> 4) **Face:** “Scrunch like you smelled something funny” → relax  
> 5) **Belly:** “Make your belly hard like a rock” → “soft like a pillow”  
> 6) **Legs/feet:** “Point toes like a ballerina” → relax

**Tip:** Pair with slow breathing during the relax phase.

### What makes it worse
- rushing through
- doing it only during panic
- making it feel like a test

---

## 6) ⛔ What NOT to do
- Avoid PMR on injured/painful muscles (modify that part)
- Don’t force if it increases distress—switch to breathing or imagery

---

## 7) 🚦 When to worry: triage guidance
Use standard red flags for urgent care (blood, dehydration, persistent vomiting, severe worsening pain, hard belly, fainting, breathing trouble).

---

## 8) 🩺 How doctors diagnose it
Clinicians evaluate symptoms; PMR is used when functional gut–brain patterns are likely and red flags absent.

---

## 9) 🧰 Treatment options
- First-line: routines + PMR + breathing + constipation plan if relevant  
- If not improving: CBT, guided imagery, hypnosis, biofeedback  
- Severe cases: urgent evaluation if red flags

---

## 10) ⏳ Expected course
Some calming happens right away; best results with **2–4 weeks** of daily practice.

---

## 11) ⚠️ Complications
Low risk. Main issue is frustration if expectations are too high.

---

## 12) 🛡️ Prevention
Daily short practice, especially before predictable triggers.

---

## 13) 🌟 Special situations
- **Teens:** use sports recovery framing  
- **Autism:** visual schedule, predictable routine  
- **School:** 1-minute version (shoulders + belly + hands)

---

## 14) 📅 Follow-up plan
Reassess after 4–8 weeks if ongoing symptoms; bring diary.

---

## 15) ❓ Parent FAQs
(Answer the five required FAQs clearly.)

---

## 16) 🧾 Printable tools
Include action plan, schedule box, diary, red flags sheet, school instructions.
