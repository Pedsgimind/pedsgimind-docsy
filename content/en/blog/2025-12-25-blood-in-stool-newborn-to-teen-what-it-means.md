Seeing blood in your child’s stool is alarming — but many causes are **treatable and not dangerous**. The key is figuring out:
- **How much blood**
- **What it looks like**
- Your child’s **age**
- Whether there are **red flags**

This guide covers the most common causes by age and what to do next.

> **Important:** This is educational guidance. If your child looks unwell or you are unsure, seek medical assessment.

## Step 1: Red flags (go to Emergency now)

Seek urgent care now if any of the following apply:

- Large amount of blood, clots, or continuous bleeding
- Black, tarry stool (possible upper GI bleeding)
- Pale, weak, dizzy, fainting, very sleepy
- Severe abdominal pain, belly swelling, or persistent vomiting
- Fever with very unwell appearance
- Bloody diarrhea with dehydration
- Baby < 3 months with significant bleeding or poor feeding
- Suspected swallowed foreign body, caustic ingestion, or trauma

---

## Step 2: What does the blood look like?

### Bright red blood on the toilet paper / outside of stool
Often from:
- Anal fissure (small tear)
- Hemorrhoids (less common in kids but possible)

### Bright red blood mixed in stool or dripping into toilet
Can be from:
- Infectious colitis
- Polyps (usually painless bleeding)
- Inflammatory bowel disease

### Dark red / maroon stool
Possible lower intestinal bleeding (more significant) — assess urgently if large amount.

### Black, tarry stool (melena)
Possible bleeding higher up (stomach/upper small intestine) — needs urgent assessment.

---

## Step 3: Causes by age

## Newborns (0–28 days)
Common possibilities:
- **Swallowed maternal blood** (from delivery or cracked nipples)
- **Anal fissure** (less common but possible)
- **Milk protein allergy** (can cause small streaks of blood/mucus)

More serious possibilities (needs urgent assessment):
- Infection
- Intestinal problems (especially if unwell, vomiting, distended belly)

---

## Infants (1–12 months)
Common:
- **Anal fissure** from constipation / hard stools
- **Milk protein allergy** (blood + mucus, irritability; may have eczema)

Important:
- Infectious colitis (diarrhea, fever)
- Intussusception (episodes of pain, pallor; sometimes blood/mucus stools)

---

## Toddlers and preschool (1–4 years)
Common:
- **Constipation → fissure** (most common)
- Infectious diarrhea (blood + diarrhea, fever)

Important:
- **Polyps** (often painless bleeding)
- Intussusception (episodic pain)
- Rare: Meckel’s diverticulum (can cause painless significant bleeding)

---

## School age (5–12 years)
Common:
- Constipation with fissure
- Infectious colitis

Important:
- **Polyps**
- **Inflammatory bowel disease** (IBD) — consider if:
  - weight loss or poor growth
  - chronic diarrhea
  - nocturnal stooling
  - anemia, fatigue
  - family history of IBD
- Celiac disease can cause symptoms, but blood is not typical unless another issue co-exists.

---

## Teens (13+ years)
Common:
- Constipation with fissure
- Infectious colitis

Important:
- IBD
- Hemorrhoids (especially with constipation/straining)
- In sexually active adolescents: proctitis or infections may be relevant and should be assessed respectfully and privately.

---

## Step 4: The most common cause overall: anal fissure (tiny tear)

Clues:
- Bright red blood on the surface of stool or toilet paper
- Pain or crying with stooling
- Hard, large stools
- Fear of stooling / withholding

What helps:
- Water and fiber
- Gentle stool softening plan guided by your clinician
- Regular toileting routine with feet supported

If bleeding keeps happening, the constipation plan often needs to be stronger and longer than expected.

---

## Step 5: What information helps your doctor

If you can, note:
- Age of child
- Amount of blood (a few streaks vs spoonfuls)
- Color (bright red vs dark vs black)
- Stool pattern (hard? diarrhea? normal?)
- Pain with stooling?
- Fever, vomiting, abdominal pain?
- Recent travel, sick contacts, new foods
- Medications (especially antibiotics, ibuprofen, iron)

A photo can help — awkward but useful for accurate assessment.

---

## Step 6: When to book a clinic appointment (not emergency)

Book an appointment soon if:
- Small bleeding episodes repeat (even if child seems well)
- Chronic constipation is present
- Blood mixed with stool (not just on paper)
- Any growth concerns, weight loss, chronic diarrhea, or fatigue

---

## Quick summary
- Many cases are from **constipation and fissures**.
- **Large bleeding**, black stool, severe pain, dehydration, or an unwell child needs urgent assessment.
- Recurrent bleeding deserves a structured evaluation to rule out polyps, infection, and IBD.
