Sometimes a child swallows a bite of meat, bread, or another solid food and suddenly says it’s stuck — or they cannot swallow afterward. This can be a **food bolus impaction** (food stuck in the esophagus) or another swallowed object.

This post explains what to do immediately and what evaluation is needed afterward.

## Step 1: Emergency signs (call emergency / go now)

Go to the Emergency Department immediately if:

- Your child **cannot swallow saliva** (drooling, spitting, pooling saliva)
- Repeated gagging or retching and cannot keep liquids down
- Any trouble breathing, noisy breathing, choking, blue color
- Severe chest/neck pain or distress
- Vomiting blood
- Suspected button battery, magnet, sharp object ingestion

If your child is drooling and cannot swallow, this is an emergency because the esophagus may be blocked.

## Step 2: What you should NOT do at home

Do not try to “push it down” with:
- big pieces of bread
- bananas
- rice balls
- carbonated drinks
- forcing more food or large drinks

These methods can worsen blockage, increase vomiting, or delay urgent care.

Do not attempt to make your child vomit on purpose.

---

## Step 3: What you CAN do while going for care

If your child is breathing comfortably but cannot swallow:

- Keep them sitting upright
- Avoid food and drink
- Go to emergency for assessment

If your child can swallow liquids and symptoms are mild:
- Avoid solids
- Take small sips of water only
- Arrange urgent medical assessment (same day) if symptoms persist

---

## Step 4: What usually happens in the Emergency Department

Depending on severity:
- Clinical assessment of breathing and ability to handle saliva
- Sometimes X-ray (mainly if a swallowed object is suspected)
- If food is truly stuck, doctors may involve gastroenterology for urgent endoscopy to remove it

---

## Step 5: The most important long-term point: why did this happen?

If a child has a true food bolus impaction (especially more than once), doctors often look for underlying causes such as:

- **Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE)** (very common)
- Esophageal narrowing (rings/stricture)
- Severe reflux with inflammation
- Motility disorders (less common)

Clues suggesting an underlying problem:
- Slow eater, chews excessively
- Needs water with each bite
- Avoids meat/bread
- Prior episodes of food “sticking”
- Allergy history (asthma/eczema/food allergies)

This is why many children need follow-up evaluation even after the acute episode is resolved.

---

## Quick summary
- If your child cannot swallow saliva or is drooling after food gets stuck: **go to the ER now**.
- Do not force bread/bananas/carbonated drinks to “push it down.”
- Repeated food-stuck events strongly suggest EoE or esophageal narrowing and need evaluation.
