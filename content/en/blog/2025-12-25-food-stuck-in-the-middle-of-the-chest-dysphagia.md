When a child says food is “stuck in the chest,” parents often think it must be choking. But many children are actually describing **esophageal swallowing difficulty** (dysphagia) — a problem in the tube from the mouth to the stomach.

Most cases are not an emergency, but **some are**. The key is knowing the red flags and getting the right assessment.

## Step 1: When it is an emergency (go now)

Go to the Emergency Department immediately if your child has any of the following:

- **Cannot swallow saliva** (drooling or spitting constantly)
- **Trouble breathing**, noisy breathing, or choking episode
- Food is stuck and your child is in distress or cannot drink liquids
- Severe chest pain, severe neck pain, or sudden worsening symptoms
- Vomiting blood
- Suspected button battery or sharp object swallowed

If your child is breathing normally and can swallow liquids, it is usually safe to arrange urgent clinic assessment, but do not ignore repeated episodes.

## Step 2: What “food stuck” usually means

Children often describe:
- “It’s stuck right here” (points to middle of chest)
- Need to drink water to push it down
- Avoiding meats/bread/rice
- Eating very slowly or chewing excessively
- Cutting food into tiny pieces
- Fear of eating in public or at school

These patterns strongly suggest **esophageal dysphagia**, not “behavior.”

## Step 3: Common causes by age

### 1) Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) — very common cause of food sticking
EoE is an allergic inflammation of the esophagus that can narrow the esophagus and cause food to stick.

Clues that raise suspicion:
- Food sticking episodes or “slow eater”
- Avoids textured foods (meat/bread)
- Needs water with every bite
- History of allergies, asthma, eczema
- Reflux symptoms that do not improve as expected

EoE is diagnosed by **endoscopy with biopsies**.

### 2) Reflux/GERD with irritation
- Burning discomfort, sour taste, regurgitation
- Sometimes causes swelling/irritation that makes swallowing uncomfortable

### 3) Esophageal narrowing (stricture) or rings
- Can happen after long-standing inflammation (including EoE) or injury
- Causes repeated sticking, especially with solid foods

### 4) Motility/coordination disorders (less common)
- Difficulty moving food down, sometimes with both liquids and solids
- May require special testing depending on the case

### 5) Anxiety after a choking event
A child may develop fear of swallowing after a scary incident. This can coexist with a medical cause, so it still deserves assessment if symptoms persist.

## Step 4: What you should do at home (if NOT an emergency)

If your child is stable and the episode has passed:

- Keep meals calm, avoid pressure
- Offer softer foods temporarily
- Encourage slow chewing and small bites
- Avoid “forcing” tough solids (meat, bread, rice) until evaluated
- Keep a symptom log:
  - What foods trigger it?
  - How often?
  - Any vomiting, pain, heartburn?
  - Any allergies/eczema/asthma?

Do NOT use large chunks of bread, bananas, or carbonated drinks as a “home dislodging method.” If food is truly stuck, this can worsen the problem.

---

## Step 5: When to book urgent clinic assessment

Book an urgent appointment if:
- Food sticking has happened more than once
- Your child is avoiding solids or losing weight
- Eating is slow and stressful
- There is chest pain with swallowing
- There is a strong allergy history

A pediatric gastroenterologist may recommend:
- Trial of reflux therapy in selected cases
- Endoscopy to check for EoE, inflammation, narrowing
- Imaging or motility tests if needed

---

## Quick summary
- “Food stuck in the chest” usually means **esophageal dysphagia**.
- Emergency if your child cannot swallow saliva, has breathing trouble, or is in distress.
- Recurrent episodes strongly suggest conditions like **EoE** or narrowing and need evaluation.
