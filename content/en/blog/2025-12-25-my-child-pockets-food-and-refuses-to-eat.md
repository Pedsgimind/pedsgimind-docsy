“Pocketing” means holding food in the cheeks or mouth instead of chewing and swallowing. Some children also refuse meals or eat very slowly. This can be frustrating — and sometimes it can signal a medical issue.

---

## Step 1: Red flags (seek urgent assessment)

Seek urgent care if:
- Choking, gagging, or coughing with meals
- Drooling, wet/gurgly voice after swallowing
- Food gets stuck and child cannot swallow saliva
- Breathing difficulty during meals
- Significant weight loss, dehydration, or inability to eat/drink

---

## Step 2: Common reasons children pocket food

### 1) Sensory or texture sensitivity (very common)
- Child avoids certain textures or new foods
- Prefers crunchy/soft-only patterns
- May pocket meats or mixed textures

### 2) Oral-motor skill delay
- Chewing skills not fully developed
- Child tires with chewing or struggles with tougher textures

### 3) Pain or discomfort with swallowing
Possible causes:
- Acid reflux irritation
- Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE)
- Tonsil/adenoid problems
Clues: slow eating, drinking a lot to wash food down, food “sticking,” recurrent vomiting, chest discomfort.

### 4) Anxiety or negative feeding experiences
After choking or gagging once, some children become fearful and avoid swallowing.

### 5) Constipation
Constipation can reduce appetite and make meals unpleasant.

## Step 3: Practical steps that often help

### Make meals predictable and calm
- Regular meal/snack schedule
- Sit at the table, feet supported
- Avoid grazing all day

### Reduce pressure
- Pressure increases refusal and anxiety
- Offer foods; let the child decide how much

### Start with “safe” textures
- Move in small steps (tiny changes)
- Pair new foods with a safe food

### Check drinking patterns
- Too much milk or juice can reduce appetite
- Water between meals is fine

### Watch for chewing/swallowing clues
If the child needs lots of water to swallow, avoids meats/breads, eats very slowly, or has recurring “stuck” episodes — discuss with your doctor.

## Step 4: When to ask for feeding therapy or specialist help

Consider referral if:
- Pocketing happens often and lasts weeks to months
- Weight gain is poor
- Meals take > 30–40 minutes regularly
- There are choking/coughing concerns
- Strong suspicion of swallowing discomfort

Some children benefit from a speech-language pathologist (feeding therapist) assessment.

---

## Quick summary
- Pocketing can be sensory, skill-based, or due to swallowing discomfort.
- Watch for choking, coughing, drooling, or food-stuck symptoms.
- Calm structure + gradual texture steps helps many families.
