# 🤢 Vomiting in Children (Newborns → Teens)
*Common causes by age, dehydration signs, red flags, and what to do today*

> ✅ **Quick note:** Vomiting is common in childhood. Most cases are caused by a short viral illness—but the **risk changes by age**. In **newborns**, vomiting can be serious even when symptoms look subtle. In **toddlers**, the biggest risk is **dehydration**. In **older children and teens**, causes broaden (migraine, constipation, appendicitis, reflux, stress). The key is spotting **red flags** early.

## 🧾 Quick “At-a-glance” box

> ✅ **Condition/topic:** Vomiting in children (age-specific guide)  
> **Common parent terms:** “Throwing up,” “spit-up,” “can’t keep anything down,” “green vomit,” “projectile vomiting”  
>
> **What it is (2–3 lines):** Vomiting is the forceful emptying of stomach contents. In many children it’s a short illness, but some vomiting patterns require urgent assessment—especially **green (bilious) vomiting**, vomiting with severe pain, dehydration, blood, or concerning behavior changes.  
>
> **Who it affects (typical ages):** All ages. **Newborns (< 1 month)** require extra caution.  
>
> ✅ **What parents should do today:**  
> - Check **red flags** first (especially green vomit and dehydration).  
> - Use **small, frequent fluids** if no red flags.  
> - Monitor urine output, energy, and pain pattern.  
>
> ⚠️ **Red flags that need urgent / ER care:**  
> - **Green (bilious) vomit** (bright green or green-yellow)  
> - Blood in vomit or black “coffee-ground” vomit  
> - Severe belly pain, worsening pain, hard/swollen belly, or pain localizing to the **right lower belly**  
> - Very sleepy, confused, weak, “not acting right,” or hard to wake  
> - Trouble breathing, repeated choking, blue color  
> - Persistent vomiting with inability to keep down fluids  
> - Severe headache, stiff neck, confusion, or vomiting after head injury  
> - Severe testicular pain/swelling with nausea/vomiting (boys)  
> - Suspected poisoning/medication ingestion (especially in toddlers/teens)  
> - **Newborn:** fever (rectal **38.0°C or higher**) or poor feeding
>
> 🟡 **When to see the family doctor/clinic soon:**

## 🧠 What it is (plain language)

Vomiting can happen when:
- The stomach or intestines are irritated (often a virus)  
- The brain’s vomiting center is triggered (migraine, head injury, severe pain)  
- The gut is blocked or twisted (rare, but urgent—especially if green vomit)  
- The body is fighting an infection (especially in newborns)

### What part of the body is involved? (small diagram required)

<!-- AI IMAGE PROMPT: Simple child-friendly diagram showing brain “vomiting center,” stomach, intestines, and appendix location. Include arrows showing: virus irritation → vomiting, migraine/head injury → vomiting, obstruction → green vomiting. Not scary, clean icons, labeled. -->
![Diagram: causes of vomiting (gut irritation vs brain triggers vs obstruction)](/images/vomiting-children-diagram-placeholder-1.png)

### Common myths vs facts
- **Myth:** “If there’s no diarrhea, it’s not a virus.”  
  **Fact:** Viruses can cause vomiting without diarrhea—especially early.
- **Myth:** “Green vomit is just bile and not serious.”  
  **Fact:** **Green (bilious) vomiting can signal an intestinal blockage** and needs urgent assessment.
- **Myth:** “If my child wants water, give a big drink.”  
  **Fact:** Big drinks can trigger more vomiting. **Small frequent sips** work best.

---

## 🧩 Why it happens (causes & triggers)

### Common causes (all ages, but vary by age)
- Viral gastroenteritis (“stomach virus”)  
- Food-related triggers (overeating, food poisoning)  
- Constipation (yes, it can cause nausea/vomiting)  
- Reflux/gastritis (especially with burning upper belly pain)  
- Migraine or abdominal migraine (older kids/teens)  
- Stress/anxiety (older kids/teens)

### Less common but important causes (brief)
- Appendicitis  
- Urinary tract infection (especially toddlers)  
- Intestinal obstruction (especially urgent with green vomit)  
- Pyloric stenosis (usually **2–8 weeks**, projectile vomiting)  
- Head injury or neurologic illness  
- Poisoning/ingestions

---

## 👀 What parents might notice (symptoms)

### Typical symptoms
- Nausea, vomiting episodes  
- Tummy cramps  
- Fever (sometimes)  
- Diarrhea (sometimes)  
- Reduced appetite and tiredness

### Symptoms by age group (high-yield)
- **Newborns (0–28 days):** feeding changes, sleepiness, fewer wet diapers, fever—may be subtle but serious  
- **Toddlers (1–4 years):** dehydration risk rises quickly; may vomit from cough/mucus, ear infection, or UTI  
- **Older children/teens:** migraine patterns, stress patterns, appendicitis clues, constipation/reflux

### What’s normal vs what’s not normal
- ✅ **Often reassuring:** brief vomiting with stable hydration, improving energy, no severe pain, no green/bloody vomit  
- ⚠️ **Not reassuring:** green vomit, blood, severe localized pain, dehydration, neurologic symptoms, newborn vomiting with fever/poor feeding

### Symptom tracker (what to write down)
- Time and number of vomits  
- Color (clear, yellow, green, bloody, coffee-ground)  
- Urine output (how often peeing/wet diapers)  
- Fever (and temperature)  
- Belly pain location and severity  
- Diarrhea or constipation symptoms  
- Headache, neck stiffness, behavior changes  
- Any possible ingestion (meds, alcohol, toxins)

---

## 🏠 Home care and what helps (step-by-step)

> ✅ **Do this now (if no red flags):** Prevent dehydration with **small, frequent fluids**.

### What to do in the first 24 hours
1) **Rest the stomach, not the child:** let them rest, but keep fluids going  
2) Offer **oral rehydration solution** (best), especially if there is diarrhea  
3) Use a **sip schedule**:
   - Give a few sips every **1–2 minutes**
   - If they vomit, wait **5–10 minutes**, then restart *slower*
4) Avoid fatty, heavy foods during active vomiting  
5) Once fluids stay down, offer simple foods as tolerated (toast, rice, soup, yogurt)

### What fluids are best?
- ✅ Oral rehydration solution is best  
- ✅ Water is okay temporarily if no ORS available  
- 🟡 Avoid large amounts of juice/pop (can worsen diarrhea)

### What usually makes it worse
- Big gulps of water  
- Forcing food during active vomiting  
- Greasy foods  
- Treating dehydration late

---

## ⛔ What NOT to do (common mistakes)

- Do not ignore **green vomit**.  
- Do not give anti-vomiting medications to **newborns** unless instructed by a clinician.  
- Do not give large drinks “to catch up.”  
- Do not assume vomiting is “just stress” if there is weight loss, morning vomiting, or headaches.

---

## 🚦 When to worry: triage guidance

### 🔴 Call 911 / Emergency now
- Trouble breathing, blue color, repeated choking  
- Collapse, severe weakness, very hard to wake  
- Severe head injury symptoms with repeated vomiting and confusion

**Example:** “My child is vomiting and is very hard to wake or acting confused.”

---

### 🟠 Same-day urgent visit (ER / urgent care)
- **Green (bilious) vomit**  
- Blood in vomit or black “coffee-ground” vomit  
- Persistent vomiting with inability to keep down fluids  
- Severe belly pain, hard/swollen belly  
- Pain localizing to the **right lower abdomen** (appendicitis concern)  
- Severe testicular pain/swelling with vomiting (boys)  
- Severe headache, stiff neck, confusion  
- Suspected poisoning/ingestion  
- **Newborn:** fever (rectal **38.0°C or higher**), poor feeding, lethargy, fewer wet diapers

**Example:** “The vomit is green and they can’t keep fluids down.”

---

### 🟡 Book a routine appointment
- Vomiting lasts > 24–48 hours  
- Recurring episodes (weekly/monthly pattern)  
- Weight loss, poor growth, chronic belly pain  
- Morning vomiting, or vomiting with headaches  
- Ongoing reflux/gastritis symptoms  
- Constipation symptoms that keep returning

**Example:** “They vomit every few weeks with headaches and light sensitivity.”

---

### 🟢 Watch at home
- Mild vomiting that is improving  
- Child can keep down small frequent fluids  
- Urine output is okay and energy is returning  
- No red flags

**Example:** “They vomited twice, now sipping fluids and peeing normally.”

---

## 🩺 How doctors diagnose it (what to expect)

### What the clinician will ask
- Vomit color (green? blood?)  
- Number of episodes and ability to keep fluids down  
- Urine output and dehydration signs  
- Belly pain location (especially right lower abdomen)  
- Fever and sick contacts  
- Headache/neck stiffness/head injury  
- Stool pattern (diarrhea vs constipation)  
- Medications and possible ingestions  
- In newborns: feeding pattern and wet diapers

### Physical exam basics
- Hydration and vital signs  
- Belly exam (tenderness, guarding, distension)  
- Throat/ears/lungs as needed  
- Neuro exam if headache/head injury concerns  
- Testicular exam if indicated (boys with lower belly pain + vomiting)

### Possible tests (and why)
- Urine test (especially toddlers with fever/vomiting)  
- Blood tests if dehydration is significant or diagnosis unclear  
- Imaging if appendicitis or obstruction concern  
- In newborns: infection evaluation if fever or concerning behavior

### What tests are usually not needed
- Extensive testing in a typical short viral illness with improving symptoms and no red flags

### What results might mean (simple interpretation)
- Viral illness: supportive care + hydration  
- Appendicitis/obstruction concerns: urgent surgical evaluation  
- Migraine patterns: targeted migraine plan  
- Constipation/reflux: treat underlying driver to stop recurrence

---

## 🧰 Treatment options

### First-line treatment (most cases)
- Oral rehydration solution + small frequent sips  
- Rest, simple foods when ready  
- Treat constipation if suspected  
- Avoid stomach irritants (for example frequent ibuprofen on an empty stomach)

### If not improving (next steps)
- Clinic reassessment for dehydration, pain pattern, and red flags  
- Consider targeted evaluation for migraine, reflux/gastritis, constipation, appendicitis, urinary infection  
- Consider referral if recurrent vomiting episodes persist

### Severe cases (hospital care)
- Significant dehydration  
- Inability to keep fluids down  
- Concern for appendicitis, obstruction, or serious infection (especially newborns)

---

## ⏳ Expected course & prognosis

### Typical timeline
- Viral vomiting often improves within **24–72 hours**  
- Appetite may take a few days to return  
- Dehydration improves quickly once fluids are tolerated

### What “getting better” looks like
- Longer gaps between vomiting  
- Able to keep down small frequent fluids  
- Urine output improves  
- Energy starts returning

### What “getting worse” looks like
- Vomiting becoming more frequent  
- New severe belly pain or localized right lower pain  
- Vomit turns green or bloody  
- Urine output drops, child becomes very sleepy

### Return to school/daycare/sports guidance
- Return when vomiting has stopped, hydration is good, and energy is adequate  
- Send water and simple snacks initially

---

## ⚠️ Complications (brief but clear)

### Common complications
- Dehydration  
- Temporary weight loss  
- Constipation after an illness (reduced intake can trigger it)

### Rare serious complications (red-flag reminder)
- Appendicitis  
- Intestinal obstruction (especially with green vomit)  
- Serious infection in newborns  
- Head injury complications

---

## 🛡️ Prevention and reducing future episodes

- Hand hygiene (reduces viral spread)  
- Hydration during illnesses  
- Avoid constipation cycles (fiber, fluids, routine)  
- Identify and treat migraine triggers in recurrent patterns  
- For reflux/gastritis: avoid frequent stomach irritants and discuss persistent symptoms with a clinician

---

## 🌟 Special situations (by age)

### 👶 Newborns (0–28 days): extra caution
> ⚠️ **In babies under 1 month, if you are unsure, it is safer to seek medical assessment.**

#### Spit-up vs vomiting (what’s the difference?)
**Spit-up (reflux) — common and usually normal**
- Small/moderate milk coming up during burping or after feeds  
- Baby otherwise looks well, feeds, gains weight  
- No green color, no blood

**Vomiting — more concerning**
- Forceful or repeated emptying of stomach contents  
- May occur with poor feeding, lethargy, fever, dehydration, belly distension

#### Newborn red flags (ER now)
- **Green (bilious) vomiting**  
- Blood in vomit  
- Repeated forceful/projectile vomiting (especially worsening)  
- Fever (rectal **38.0°C or higher**)  
- Very sleepy, limp, “not acting right”  
- Poor feeding or fewer wet diapers  
- Swollen/firm belly, no stool/gas with worsening vomiting  
- Breathing difficulty, repeated choking, blue color

#### Common causes in newborns
- Normal reflux/overfeeding  
- Infection (can be subtle—needs urgent evaluation if fever/lethargy/poor feeding)  
- Milk protein allergy (possible)  
- Pyloric stenosis (often 2–8 weeks; projectile vomiting; hungry after vomiting)  
- Intestinal obstruction (emergency—often with green vomit)

#### What you can safely do at home (only if no red flags)
- Smaller, more frequent feeds  
- Burp more often  
- Keep upright 20–30 minutes after feeds  
- Monitor wet diapers and alertness  
- No anti-vomiting medicines unless clinician instructed

---

### 👧🧒 Toddlers (1–4 years): dehydration-focused
#### Most common causes
- Viral gastroenteritis  
- Food-related causes (overeating, food poisoning)  
- Constipation  
- Ear infection/respiratory illness (vomiting from coughing/mucus/fever)  
- Urinary tract infection (can present as fever + vomiting)

#### How to tell if dehydration is starting
- Dry mouth, cracked lips  
- Fewer wet diapers/less peeing  
- No tears when crying  
- Sunken eyes  
- Unusual sleepiness or irritability  
- Fast breathing or fast heart rate

---

### 🧑‍🎓 Older children and teens: broader causes
#### Common causes in older kids/teens
1) Viral gastroenteritis  
2) Appendicitis (important not to miss)  
3) Migraine / abdominal migraine  
4) Constipation  
5) Reflux / gastritis  
6) Anxiety/stress patterns

#### Appendicitis clues (seek urgent assessment)
- Pain starts around belly button then moves to **right lower belly**  
- Pain worsens with movement/jumping  
- Reduced appetite, fever, vomiting

#### Migraine / abdominal migraine clues
- Episodes of vomiting with headache  
- Sensitivity to light/sound  
- Family history of migraine  
- Belly pain can be the main symptom in some children

---

## 📅 Follow-up plan

- Follow up with your clinician if:
  - vomiting lasts > 24–48 hours  
  - hydration is borderline  
  - belly pain persists or localizes  
  - vomiting recurs in episodes (weekly/monthly pattern)  
- Bring:
  - timeline of vomiting episodes  
  - urine output estimate  
  - fever measurements  
  - pain location pattern  
  - headache history, constipation symptoms, and triggers

---

## ❓ Parent FAQs

### “Is it contagious?”
Often yes when it’s viral. Hand hygiene and cleaning shared surfaces help.

### “Can my child eat ___?”
During active vomiting, focus on fluids. Once fluids stay down, offer simple foods as tolerated. Avoid forcing food.

### “Can they bathe/swim/exercise?”
Yes if hydrated and energy is normal. Avoid intense activity during active vomiting or dehydration.

### “Will they outgrow it?”
Most viral vomiting episodes resolve. Recurrent patterns (migraine, reflux, constipation) improve with targeted management.

### “When can we stop treatment?”
When your child is drinking normally, peeing normally, and vomiting has stopped. Continue monitoring for 24 hours.
