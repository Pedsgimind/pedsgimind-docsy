Vomiting in older children is still often caused by a virus, but as kids get older the list of causes becomes broader. The key is identifying **red flags** and treating dehydration early.

---

## Step 1: Red flags (Emergency now)

Seek urgent care if vomiting happens with any of the following:

- **Green (bilious) vomit**
- Blood in vomit or black coffee-ground material
- Severe belly pain, worsening pain, or pain that localizes to the **right lower belly**
- Stiff neck, severe headache, confusion, repeated vomiting after head injury
- Signs of dehydration (very little urine, dizziness, fainting)
- Persistent vomiting with inability to keep down fluids
- Severe testicular pain (in boys) with nausea/vomiting
- Suspected poisoning, drug ingestion, or severe alcohol exposure (teens)

---

## Step 2: Common causes in older kids

### 1) Viral gastroenteritis
- Still the most common
- Often with diarrhea/cramps, sometimes fever

### 2) Appendicitis (important not to miss)
Clues:
- Pain starts around the belly button then moves to right lower belly
- Pain worsens with movement/jumping
- Fever, reduced appetite, vomiting
If you suspect appendicitis: seek urgent assessment.

### 3) Migraine / abdominal migraine
- Episodes of vomiting with headache or sensitivity to light/sound
- Some children have belly pain as the main symptom

### 4) Constipation
Can cause nausea/vomiting + belly pain + reduced appetite.

### 5) Reflux / gastritis
- Burning upper belly pain, sour taste, nausea
- Can be triggered by infection, ibuprofen, stress, spicy foods

### 6) Anxiety/stress
Stress can significantly affect the gut. Some kids vomit with school stress, performance anxiety, or panic.

## Step 3: Home care (when no red flags)

- Start oral rehydration solution or clear fluids in small sips
- Avoid fatty foods while actively vomiting
- Use a simple “sip schedule”: a few sips every 1–2 minutes
- Rest, monitor urine output and energy

---

## Step 4: When to call your doctor soon

- Vomiting lasts > 24–48 hours
- Recurring vomiting episodes (weekly or monthly pattern)
- Weight loss, poor growth, chronic belly pain
- Vomiting mostly in the morning, or vomiting with headaches

---

## Quick summary
- Most vomiting is viral, but older kids have more possible causes.
- The big danger signs are **green vomit, blood, dehydration, severe localized pain, or neurologic symptoms**.
