Vomiting in a newborn can be frightening. Many babies spit up — and most of the time it’s not dangerous. But in the first month of life, **some types of vomiting need urgent medical assessment**.

This guide will help you recognize:
- What is likely **normal spit-up**
- What is **concerning vomiting**
- The most important **red flags** (especially **green/bilious vomiting**)
- What you can do at home (when it is safe)
- When to go to the emergency department

> **Important:** In babies under 1 month, if you are unsure, it is safer to seek medical assessment.

## Step 1: Red flags (go to Emergency now)

Seek urgent care now if your newborn has vomiting PLUS any of the following:

### Vomit appearance
- **Green (bilious) vomiting** → treat as an emergency until proven otherwise
- **Blood in vomit** (bright red or coffee-ground material)
- Vomiting that is **forceful/projectile** repeatedly (especially after feeds)

### Baby’s condition
- **Very sleepy**, hard to wake, unusually limp, or “not acting right”
- **Breathing difficulty**, repeated choking, blue color, or pauses in breathing
- **Fever** (rectal temperature **38.0°C or higher**) in a baby < 3 months
- **Poor feeding** or refusing feeds
- **Signs of dehydration**:
  - Very dry mouth
  - No tears (older infants)
  - Fewer wet diapers (often **< 4 wet diapers/day** is concerning in young babies)
  - Sunken soft spot
  - Very sleepy or weak

### Belly / stools
- Swollen/firm belly
- No stool or no passing gas with worsening vomiting
- Blood in stool

If any red flag is present: **do not wait at home**.

## Step 2: Spit-up vs vomiting (what’s the difference?)

### “Spit-up” (reflux) — common and usually normal
- Small to moderate amounts of milk coming up
- Often occurs during burping or shortly after feeds
- Baby otherwise looks well, feeds, and gains weight
- No green color, no blood
- Usually improves gradually over time

### “Vomiting” — more concerning
- Forceful or repeated emptying of stomach contents
- May be associated with poor feeding, dehydration, lethargy, fever, or belly distension

---

## Step 3: Common causes in newborns

### 1) Normal reflux / overfeeding
- Most common
- Triggered by large feeds, fast flow, swallowing air
- Baby generally well

### 2) Viral illness or infection
- In newborns, infections can be serious even with subtle symptoms
- Vomiting with fever, lethargy, or poor feeding needs urgent evaluation

### 3) Milk protein allergy (less common in the first weeks but possible)
Clues:
- Blood or mucus in stool
- Eczema, irritability
- Poor feeding, reflux-like symptoms
This usually needs a clinician-guided plan.

### 4) Pyloric stenosis (typically starts around 2–8 weeks)
Clues:
- Worsening **projectile vomiting**
- Hungry after vomiting
- Poor weight gain, dehydration
This is urgent but usually not “green.”

### 5) Intestinal obstruction (emergency)
Clues:
- **Green (bilious) vomiting**
- Swollen belly, severe irritability, poor feeding
Examples include malrotation/volvulus and other obstructive conditions.

## Step 4: What you can safely do at home (only if no red flags)

If your baby is alert, feeding reasonably, has normal wet diapers, and vomit is NOT green or bloody:

### Feeding adjustments
- Offer **smaller, more frequent feeds**
- Burp more often (mid-feed and after feed)
- Keep baby upright for **20–30 minutes** after feeds
- If bottle-feeding: consider slower flow nipple if feeds are very fast

### Monitor closely
- Wet diapers, alertness, feeding volume
- Any new fever, green vomit, or worsening pattern → seek care

Do not give anti-vomiting medications to a newborn unless instructed by a clinician.

## Step 5: When to book a clinic visit (not emergency)

Book an appointment soon if:
- Spit-up is frequent and baby seems uncomfortable most feeds
- Poor weight gain
- Suspected feeding difficulty (choking, coughing, very prolonged feeds)
- Persistent vomiting but baby otherwise stable

---

## Quick summary
- Spit-up is common, but **newborn vomiting requires caution**.
- **Green (bilious) vomiting is an emergency**.
- Fever, lethargy, dehydration, blood, belly swelling, or projectile vomiting need urgent assessment.
