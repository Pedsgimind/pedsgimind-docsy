Vomiting in toddlers is very common. Most of the time it is caused by a short viral illness and improves within 1–2 days. The biggest risks are **dehydration** and missing the smaller number of cases that need urgent care.

---

## Step 1: Red flags (go to Emergency now)

Seek urgent care now if your toddler has vomiting plus any of the following:

- **Green (bilious) vomit**
- **Blood** in vomit or black “coffee-ground” material
- Severe or worsening abdominal pain, belly swelling, or a hard/tender belly
- Very sleepy, confused, weak, or hard to wake
- Trouble breathing
- Signs of dehydration (see below) or cannot keep any fluids down for many hours
- Severe headache, stiff neck, or repeated vomiting after a head injury
- Possible poisoning or medication ingestion

## Step 2: Most common causes in toddlers

### 1) Viral gastroenteritis (stomach virus)
- Most common
- May include diarrhea, cramps, low-grade fever
- Usually improves within 24–72 hours

### 2) Food-related causes
- Overeating, new foods, food intolerance
- Food poisoning (sudden vomiting, may have diarrhea; others who ate same food may get sick)

### 3) Constipation
Yes — constipation can trigger nausea and vomiting in toddlers, especially with belly pain and reduced appetite.

### 4) Ear infection / respiratory illness
Some toddlers vomit from coughing, mucus, or fever.

### 5) Urinary tract infection (UTI)
In toddlers, UTI can present as fever and vomiting without obvious urinary symptoms.

## Step 3: How to tell if dehydration is starting

Concerning signs:
- Dry mouth, cracked lips
- Fewer wet diapers / fewer trips to pee
- No tears when crying
- Sunken eyes
- Fast breathing or fast heart rate
- Child is unusually sleepy or irritable

If you are unsure, treat it seriously and seek assessment.

## Step 4: What to do at home (when no red flags)

### The golden rule: small, frequent fluids
- Use an oral rehydration solution (preferred), especially if there is diarrhea
- Give **small sips every 1–2 minutes**
- If your child vomits, wait 5–10 minutes and start again even slower

### What fluids are best?
- Oral rehydration solution is best
- If not available: water in small amounts temporarily is okay
- Avoid large volumes of juice or pop (can worsen diarrhea)

### Food
- Once fluids stay down, offer simple foods as tolerated (toast, rice, soup, yogurt)
- Do not force eating during active vomiting

---

## Step 5: When to book a clinic visit

- Vomiting lasts more than 24–48 hours
- Weight loss, persistent belly pain, or recurring episodes
- Vomiting with frequent headaches, especially morning vomiting
- Concerns about constipation, reflux, or food triggers

---

## Quick summary
- Most toddler vomiting is viral and improves quickly.
- Focus on **preventing dehydration** with small frequent fluids.
- **Green vomit, blood, severe pain, or dehydration** means urgent care.
