Parents often worry: “My child is not growing.” Growth is one of the best overall indicators of a child’s health — but not all “small” children have a medical problem.

This guide explains:
- When growth patterns are normal
- When growth is concerning
- Common causes
- What evaluation usually includes

---

## Step 1: The most important idea: the growth pattern matters

Doctors look at:
- Height and weight **over time**
- Whether a child is following their curve
- Whether the child is **dropping percentiles**
- Family growth pattern (parents’ heights)
- Puberty timing

### Common normal patterns
- **Familial short stature:** child is healthy, short like parents, steady growth
- **Constitutional delay:** “late bloomer” pattern, slower early growth, later puberty, catches up

---

## Step 2: Red flags (book urgent assessment)

Seek prompt medical review if:
- Rapid drop in weight or height percentiles
- Child looks unwell, very tired, pale, or has frequent fevers
- Chronic diarrhea, blood in stool, persistent vomiting
- Severe abdominal pain, poor appetite for weeks
- Delayed puberty beyond expected age ranges
- Signs of dehydration or severe weight loss

---

## Step 3: Common reasons children don’t grow well

### 1) Not enough calories (most common)
Reasons include:
- Very picky eating / grazing but low intake
- Drinking too much milk/juice and not eating enough solids
- Feeding battles, stress at meals
- Sensory feeding issues or swallowing discomfort

### 2) Poor absorption (malabsorption)
Examples:
- Celiac disease
- Chronic diarrhea syndromes
- Pancreatic problems (less common)
Clues: bulky stools, greasy stools, bloating, poor weight gain.

### 3) Chronic inflammation or chronic disease
Examples:
- Inflammatory bowel disease
- Kidney disease
- Heart disease
- Chronic infections
Clues: fatigue, anemia, chronic belly pain, diarrhea, fevers, poor appetite.

### 4) Hormonal or endocrine causes (more height than weight)
Examples:
- Hypothyroidism
- Growth hormone deficiency
Clues: slowing height velocity, sometimes delayed puberty.

### 5) Feeding/swallowing discomfort
If eating causes pain or food “gets stuck,” children may eat less, leading to poor growth.

## Step 4: What the evaluation usually includes

### A) History
- What a typical day of eating looks like (including drinks)
- Stool pattern (constipation, diarrhea, blood)
- Sleep, energy, school performance
- Family heights and puberty timing

### B) Physical exam
- Accurate height/weight measurements
- Puberty staging (when appropriate)
- Signs of anemia, chronic disease, or malnutrition

### C) Common tests (selected based on the child)
- Blood count and iron studies (anemia)
- Inflammation markers
- Thyroid function
- Celiac screening
- Basic kidney/liver tests
- Stool tests if diarrhea is present

Sometimes a dietitian assessment is the single most helpful step.

## Step 5: What you can do at home while waiting

- Keep a 3-day food diary (including drinks)
- Offer structured meals + snacks (avoid constant grazing)
- Add calories in a healthy way (oil, nut butters if safe, cheese, yogurt)
- Treat constipation if present (constipation reduces appetite)
- Avoid pressure and battles at meals — it often backfires

---

## Quick summary
- Many small children are normal (family pattern or late bloomer).
- The biggest warning sign is **falling off the growth curve**.
- The most common cause is **not enough calories**, but gut and medical causes must be considered if there are symptoms.
