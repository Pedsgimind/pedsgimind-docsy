# 🍼🚨 FPIES (Food Protein–Induced Enterocolitis Syndrome): A Serious but Treatable Food Reaction in Infants & Young Children

> ⚠️ FPIES is **not a typical food allergy** and often **does not cause hives or wheezing**.  
> It causes **delayed, repetitive vomiting** (and sometimes diarrhea and lethargy) after eating a trigger food.  
> With the right plan, most children **do very well and outgrow FPIES**.

## 1) 🧾 Quick “At-a-glance” box (top of page)

> ✅ **Condition name:** Food Protein–Induced Enterocolitis Syndrome (FPIES)  
> **Common names:** Delayed food reaction, non-IgE food allergy  
>
> **Plain-language summary (2–3 lines):**  
> FPIES is a delayed immune reaction in the gut that happens **1–4 hours after eating a trigger food**. It can cause severe vomiting, diarrhea, and lethargy, sometimes leading to dehydration or shock-like symptoms. It does **not** usually cause hives or breathing problems.
>
> **Who it affects (typical ages):**  
> Most common in **infants and toddlers**, often starting when solids or formula are introduced.
>
> ✅ **What parents should do today:**  
> - Avoid known trigger foods.  
> - Have a **clear emergency plan** for accidental exposure.  
> - Know when to go to the ER (section 7).  
> - Work with your clinician on safe food introduction.
>
> ⚠️ **Red flags that need urgent/ER care:**  
> - Repeated vomiting 1–4 hours after a food  
> - Extreme sleepiness, limpness, pallor  
> - Diarrhea with dehydration  
> - Low urine output  
> - Cold, clammy skin or shock-like symptoms
>
> 🟡 **When to see the family doctor/clinic:**  
> - Recurrent vomiting episodes linked to the same food  
> - Poor weight gain or feeding refusal  
> - Blood or mucus in stools  
> - Need for diagnosis, food planning, or daycare/school plan

## 2) 🧠 What it is (plain language)

FPIES is a **gut-specific immune reaction** to certain foods.  
Unlike classic food allergy:
- it is **delayed** (not immediate),
- it usually **does not involve skin or breathing symptoms**,
- and standard allergy tests are often negative.

### Common myths vs facts
- **Myth:** “No hives means it’s not an allergy.”  
  **Fact:** FPIES is an immune reaction without hives.
- **Myth:** “It’s just a stomach bug.”  
  **Fact:** FPIES episodes repeat with the same food and pattern.
- **Myth:** “Skin tests will confirm it.”  
  **Fact:** FPIES is usually diagnosed by history, not skin tests.

---

## 3) 🧩 Why it happens (causes & triggers)

The immune system in the gut reacts abnormally to specific food proteins, causing inflammation, fluid shifts, and vomiting.

### Common FPIES trigger foods
*(Varies by region and child)*

- Cow’s milk  
- Soy  
- Rice  
- Oats  
- Other grains  
- Egg  
- Poultry  
- Fish  
- Some fruits/vegetables (less common)

> 🟡 **Important:** A child may react to **one food only** or **multiple foods**.

### Risk factors
- FPIES to one food increases risk for FPIES to another
- Family history of allergy (not required)
- Early infancy solid introduction (association, not cause)

---

## 4) 👀 What parents might notice (symptoms)

### Typical acute FPIES reaction
Occurs **1–4 hours after eating**:
- Repetitive, forceful vomiting
- Pale, grayish skin
- Lethargy (very sleepy, floppy)
- Diarrhea (may occur later, 6–24 hours)
- Low blood pressure in severe cases

### Chronic FPIES (with daily exposure)
- Poor weight gain
- Chronic diarrhea
- Vomiting
- Feeding refusal
- Irritability

### What’s normal vs what’s not
⚠️ **Not normal / concerning:**
- Same vomiting pattern after same food
- Vomiting without fever
- Lethargy after eating
- Dehydration

### Symptom tracker (what to write down)
- Exact food eaten
- Time from eating to vomiting
- Number of vomits
- Diarrhea timing
- Child’s alertness
- Hydration/urine output
- ER visits and treatments given

---

## 5) 🏠 Home care and what helps (step-by-step)

> ⚠️ **Important:** FPIES reactions can become serious quickly.  
> Home care is only for **prevention and recovery**, not for managing severe reactions.

### ✅ What to do after diagnosis
- **Strictly avoid trigger foods**
- Read labels carefully
- Introduce new foods **one at a time**
- Keep a written **FPIES action plan**

### After a mild accidental exposure
> 🟡 **Watch closely:**
- Offer oral rehydration if vomiting is mild and stopping
- Monitor urine output
- Seek care early if vomiting continues

### After a moderate–severe reaction
> ⚠️ **Urgent / ER:**
- Repetitive vomiting
- Lethargy or pallor
- Poor hydration

---

## 6) ⛔ What NOT to do (common mistakes)

- Don’t try trigger foods again “to check.”
- Don’t assume antihistamines will help (they don’t treat FPIES).
- Don’t delay ER care if vomiting is repetitive or child is lethargic.
- Don’t introduce many new foods at once.

### Medication cautions
- Epinephrine is **not routinely helpful** in FPIES unless there is a rare IgE-type reaction overlap.
- Treatment in ER is usually **IV fluids ± ondansetron**.

---

## 7) 🚦 When to worry: triage guidance

### 🔴 Call 911 / Emergency now
- Repeated vomiting with extreme lethargy
- Pale/gray color, cold or clammy skin
- Signs of shock (weak pulse, unresponsiveness)

**Example:** “My baby vomited many times and is floppy and very sleepy.”

### 🟠 Same-day urgent visit
- Vomiting 1–4 hours after eating
- Diarrhea with dehydration signs
- Poor urine output
- Child looks unwell after a known trigger

### 🟡 Book a routine appointment
- Suspected FPIES pattern
- Poor growth or feeding difficulty
- Need safe feeding plan or daycare letter

### 🟢 Watch at home
- Child is recovering, hydrated, alert, and vomiting has stopped (clinician guidance recommended)

---

## 8) 🩺 How doctors diagnose it (what to expect)

### What the clinician will ask
- Detailed food history
- Timing of vomiting after foods
- Pattern repetition
- ER treatments required
- Growth and feeding history

### Physical exam basics
- Hydration
- Growth
- Abdominal exam

### Possible tests (and why)
- Often **no single test**
- Blood tests during acute episode may show dehydration or inflammation
- IgE testing may be done to rule out classic allergy (often negative)

### Oral food challenge
- Done **only in specialist settings**
- Used to confirm diagnosis or test for outgrowing

---

## 9) 🧰 Treatment options

### First-line management
- Trigger food avoidance
- Safe food list
- Emergency plan

### Acute reaction management (medical setting)
- IV fluids
- Ondansetron
- Monitoring

### If not improving / complex cases
- Pediatric GI and allergy referral
- Dietitian involvement
- Nutritional supplementation if needed

---

## 10) ⏳ Expected course & prognosis

- Many children outgrow FPIES by **3–5 years** (varies by food)
- Milk/soy FPIES may resolve earlier
- Grain or multiple-food FPIES may take longer

### What “getting better” looks like
- Tolerating more foods
- Successful supervised food challenges
- Normal growth and feeding

---

## 11) ⚠️ Complications (brief but clear)

### Common complications
- Dehydration during reactions
- Feeding anxiety
- Limited diet

### Rare serious complications
- Shock during severe reactions
- Poor growth if not managed properly

---

## 12) 🛡️ Prevention and reducing future episodes

- Avoid known triggers
- Introduce new foods slowly
- Keep a written plan
- Educate all caregivers

---

## 13) 🌟 Special situations

### Infants
Most common age group; formula choice may be important.

### Breastfed babies
FPIES reactions are uncommon via breast milk but possible in rare cases.

### Multiple-food FPIES
Needs specialist and dietitian support.

### Neurodevelopmental differences
Careful feeding progression and support needed.

### Travel considerations
Carry written FPIES plan and safe foods.

### School/daycare notes
Staff must recognize delayed vomiting and act quickly.

---

## 14) 📅 Follow-up plan

- Regular growth monitoring
- Re-evaluation for food challenges (specialist)
- Update action plan yearly

---

## 15) ❓ Parent FAQs

### “Is it contagious?”
No.

### “Is this an allergy?”
Yes—but a **non-IgE–mediated** allergy.

### “Will my child outgrow it?”
Most children do.

### “Can antihistamines help?”
No.

### “When can we reintroduce the food?”
Only under specialist guidance.
