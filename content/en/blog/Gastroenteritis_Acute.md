# 🤢💧 Acute Gastroenteritis in Children (Stomach Bug): A Parent-Friendly Guide

> ✅ Acute gastroenteritis (“stomach bug”) is a common infection that causes **vomiting and/or diarrhea**.  
> The most important treatment is **hydration**. Most children improve in a few days, but dehydration can become serious—so knowing red flags matters.

---

## 1) 🧾 Quick “At-a-glance” box (top of page)

> ✅ **Condition name:** Acute Gastroenteritis  
> **Common names:** Stomach bug, viral gastroenteritis, stomach flu (not influenza)  
>
> **Plain-language summary (2–3 lines):**  
> A stomach bug usually spreads easily and causes vomiting, diarrhea, belly cramps, and sometimes fever. Most cases are viral and improve with supportive care. The biggest risk is **dehydration**, especially in infants and young children.
>
> **Who it affects (typical ages):**  
> All ages, but dehydration risk is highest in **infants and toddlers**.
>
> ✅ **What parents should do today:**  
> - Focus on **oral rehydration** (small frequent sips)  
> - Continue feeding as tolerated  
> - Watch urine output and energy level  
> - Keep good hand hygiene to prevent spread
>
> ⚠️ **Red flags that need urgent/ER care:**  
> - No urine for 8–12 hours (or fewer wet diapers)  
> - Very sleepy, hard to wake, limp  
> - Blood in stool or black stools  
> - Green vomit (bright green)  
> - Signs of severe dehydration (dry mouth, sunken eyes, fast breathing)  
>
> 🟡 **When to see the family doctor/clinic:**  
> - Diarrhea lasting > 7 days  
> - Ongoing vomiting > 24 hours with poor intake  
> - Infant under 3 months with fever  
> - Significant belly pain or concern for dehydration

## 2) 🧠 What it is (plain language)

Acute gastroenteritis is inflammation of the stomach and intestines caused by germs (usually viruses).

It leads to:
- vomiting
- diarrhea
- belly cramps
- sometimes fever

### What part of the body is involved? (small diagram required)

### Common myths vs facts
- **Myth:** “No food at all until diarrhea stops.”  
  **Fact:** Feeding helps healing; hydration is the priority.
- **Myth:** “Antibiotics are needed.”  
  **Fact:** Most cases are viral; antibiotics rarely help and can harm.
- **Myth:** “Clear fluids like juice are best.”  
  **Fact:** Juice can worsen diarrhea. Oral rehydration solution is best.

## 3) 🧩 Why it happens (causes & triggers)

### Common causes
- Viruses (most common)
- Bacteria (sometimes)
- Parasites (less common)

### Triggers that worsen symptoms
- juice and sugary drinks
- large meals during active vomiting
- dehydration
- greasy foods early on

### Risk factors
- daycare/school outbreaks
- sick household contacts
- travel
- poor hand hygiene

---

## 4) 👀 What parents might notice (symptoms)

### Typical symptoms
- vomiting (often first)
- watery diarrhea
- belly cramps
- fever (sometimes)
- decreased appetite

### Symptoms by age group
- **Infants:** fewer wet diapers, fussiness, sleepiness  
- **Toddlers:** accidents, refusal to drink, fast dehydration  
- **Older kids/teens:** nausea, cramps, frequent stools

### What’s normal vs what’s not
✅ Common:
- low fever
- mild cramping
- diarrhea for several days

⚠️ Concerning:
- blood in stool
- severe abdominal pain (localized)
- green vomit
- persistent lethargy
- dehydration signs

### Symptom trackers (what to write down)
- number of vomits
- number of diarrhea stools
- urine output (wet diapers/peeing)
- fever readings
- fluids taken (how much)

---

## 5) 🏠 Home care and what helps (step-by-step)

> ✅ Most children can be safely treated at home if they stay hydrated.

### First 24–48 hours: hydration plan
> ✅ **Do this now:**
1) Use **oral rehydration solution** (ORS) if possible  
2) Give **small sips frequently** (every 1–2 minutes)  
3) If vomiting occurs, wait 5–10 minutes, then restart with smaller sips  
4) Track wet diapers/urine output

### How much to give (simple, practical)
- Aim for frequent small amounts rather than big cups.
- If your child vomits with larger amounts, reduce volume and increase frequency.

### What to feed
- Continue breast milk or formula for infants
- Offer bland foods as tolerated:
  - toast, rice, pasta, banana
  - soups, yogurt (if tolerated)
- Do not force food; hydration matters most.

### What usually makes it worse
- fruit juice, soda, sports drinks (too sugary)
- large, fatty meals early on

---

## 6) ⛔ What NOT to do (common mistakes)

- Don’t give juice as the main fluid.
- Don’t give anti-diarrheal medicines to young children unless advised.
- Don’t stop breastfeeding.
- Don’t wait too long for dehydration signs to worsen.

### When not to give over-the-counter medications
- Avoid anti-diarrheals in young children.
- Avoid aspirin.
- Use fever medicines only as directed for age/weight.

---

## 7) 🚦 When to worry: triage guidance

### 🔴 Call 911 / Emergency now
- very sleepy or hard to wake
- blue lips, difficulty breathing
- signs of shock (cold clammy skin, very weak)

**Example:** “My child is floppy and not responding.”

### 🟠 Same-day urgent visit
- no urine 8–12 hours (or no wet diaper for many hours)
- persistent vomiting with inability to keep fluids down
- blood in stool
- green vomit
- severe belly pain (especially one spot)

**Example:** “Can’t keep any sips down for hours and no urine.”

### 🟡 Book a routine appointment
- diarrhea > 7 days
- recurring episodes
- concerns about weight loss or poor growth
- suspected food intolerance after infection

### 🟢 Watch at home
- mild symptoms with good drinking, peeing, and alertness

---

## 8) 🩺 How doctors diagnose it (what to expect)

### What the clinician will ask
- fluid intake and urine output
- vomiting/diarrhea frequency
- fever pattern
- exposure (daycare, travel)
- blood in stool

### Physical exam basics
- hydration check (mouth, tears, skin, pulse)
- belly exam

### Possible tests (and why)
- usually none
- stool test if blood in stool, severe illness, or prolonged diarrhea
- blood tests if dehydration is significant

### What tests are usually not needed
- imaging unless severe localized pain suggests something else

---

## 9) 🧰 Treatment options

### First-line treatment
- oral rehydration solution
- continued feeding as tolerated
- rest

### If not improving
- clinic assessment for dehydration
- anti-nausea medicine in selected cases (clinician-directed)

### Severe cases (hospital care)
- IV fluids for dehydration
- monitoring electrolytes

#### Medication/treatment notes
- **What it does:** prevents dehydration, supports recovery  
- **Common side effects:** ORS may taste salty; vomiting may still occur early  
- **When to stop and seek help:** worsening dehydration, blood, green vomit, severe pain

---

## 10) ⏳ Expected course & prognosis

- Vomiting often improves in **1–2 days**
- Diarrhea often improves in **3–7 days**
- Appetite may take a week to return fully

### What “getting better” looks like
- more energy
- peeing more
- fewer vomits
- stools gradually thicken

### Return to school/daycare/sports
- when fever-free and improving
- ensure hydration and bathroom access

---

## 11) ⚠️ Complications (brief but clear)

### Common complications
- dehydration
- temporary lactose intolerance after infection

### Rare serious complications
- severe dehydration requiring IV fluids
- bacterial infection needing targeted treatment

---

## 12) 🛡️ Prevention and reducing future episodes

- handwashing with soap and water
- disinfect bathroom surfaces
- avoid sharing drinks/utensils
- vaccines (where available) reduce severe disease

---

## 13) 🌟 Special situations

### Infants
Dehydrate quickly—lower threshold for medical evaluation.

### Teens
Sports drinks are not the same as ORS; choose ORS if dehydrated.

### Kids with chronic conditions or immunosuppression
Seek earlier medical advice.

### Neurodevelopmental differences/autism
Use preferred cups/straws and small frequent sips; avoid fights about food.

### Travel considerations
Carry ORS packets.

### School/daycare notes
Return when improving; encourage frequent drinking and bathroom access.

---

## 14) 📅 Follow-up plan

- If symptoms improve: no follow-up needed.
- Follow up if:
  - diarrhea persists > 7 days
  - poor intake continues
  - weight loss occurs
  - repeated episodes happen

---

## 15) ❓ Parent FAQs

### “Is it contagious?”
Yes—very. Handwashing is key.

### “Can my child eat ___?”
Yes as tolerated. Focus on fluids first, then bland foods.

### “Can they bathe/swim/exercise?”
Bathing is fine. Avoid swimming during active diarrhea. Exercise only when hydrated and feeling well.

### “Will they outgrow it?”
This is an infection, not a chronic disease—most recover fully.

### “When can we stop treatment?”
When your child is drinking well, peeing normally, and symptoms are resolving.
