## 2) 🧠 What it is (plain language)

A liver biopsy is a way to **look directly at liver cells**.

Doctors may need it to:
- confirm the exact diagnosis
- see how much inflammation or scarring (fibrosis) is present
- check response to treatment
- rule out certain conditions

### What part of the body is involved? (small diagram required)

### Common myths vs facts
- **Myth:** “A biopsy removes a big piece of the liver.”  
  **Fact:** The sample is **tiny**—about the size of a grain of rice.
- **Myth:** “It’s extremely dangerous.”  
  **Fact:** Serious complications are **uncommon**, especially in children.
- **Myth:** “It’s always needed.”  
  **Fact:** Many liver conditions are diagnosed without biopsy; it’s used when it adds important information.

## 3) 🧩 Why it’s done (indications)

Doctors may recommend a liver biopsy to:
- confirm a diagnosis (for example, autoimmune hepatitis)
- assess unexplained abnormal liver tests
- evaluate scarring (fibrosis or cirrhosis)
- guide treatment choices
- assess severity before major decisions (like transplant evaluation)

### Situations where biopsy may **not** be needed
- clear diagnosis from blood tests and imaging
- conditions where biopsy won’t change management
- when noninvasive tests are sufficient

- shoulder discomfort (referred pain) for a short time
- tiredness from sedation

### What’s normal vs what’s not
✅ Normal:
- mild pain improving over hours
