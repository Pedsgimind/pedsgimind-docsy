## 7) 🚦 When to worry: triage guidance

### 🔴 Call 911 / Emergency now
Trouble breathing, blue lips, fainting, severe chest pain, shock symptoms.

### 🟠 Same-day urgent visit
Severe dehydration, persistent vomiting, blood in stool/vomit, severe worsening belly pain, hard belly.

### 🟡 Book a routine appointment
Recurrent pain affecting school, constipation not improving, suspected functional disorder needing plan.

### 🟢 Watch at home
Mild symptoms that improve with rest, hydration, gentle movement, and no red flags.

---

## 8) 🩺 How doctors diagnose it
Clinicians evaluate cause; yoga is supportive for gut–brain and constipation-related discomfort when safe.

---

## 9) 🧰 Treatment options

### First-line
- routines (sleep/meals/hydration)
- constipation plan if relevant
- breathing + gentle yoga

### If not improving
- CBT, guided imagery, hypnosis, biofeedback
- consider diet adjustments only with guidance if restrictive patterns developing

### Severe cases
urgent evaluation if red flags.

---

## 10) ⏳ Expected course & prognosis
- Calming can be immediate  
- Best symptom improvement often with **2–6 weeks** of regular practice

### Return to school/sports
- Encourage normal activity; yoga can be a “reset tool” not a replacement for play and movement.

---

## 11) ⚠️ Complications
Low risk when gentle. Risk increases if:
- child pushes into pain
- dehydration/illness present
- advanced poses attempted

---

## 12) 🛡️ Prevention and reducing future episodes
- 5–10 minutes daily or 3–4 times/week
- move after long sitting
- pair with breathing at school-morning triggers

---

- **Infants:** not applicable  
- **Teens:** self-guided routines; privacy-friendly  
- **Chronic conditions:** modify for mobility/energy  
- **Autism:** visual cards, predictable sequence, favorite music  
- **Travel:** easy poses in hotel room; breathing + knees-to-chest

### School/daycare notes
Allow brief stretch break and water access; avoid stigma.

---

If symptoms persist or school impacted, follow up with clinician; bring diary and stool pattern notes.

---
