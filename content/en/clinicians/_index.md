# For Clinicians
High-yield pediatric GI triage, red flags, and practical algorithms (quick links).

---

## Triage: High-risk presentations (do not miss)

### Vomiting
- **Bilious vomiting** in any infant/child → treat as possible obstruction until proven otherwise
- Newborn vomiting + lethargy/poor feeding/fever → consider sepsis evaluation and hydration

### Swallowing complaints
- **Food bolus with inability to handle secretions** (drooling/spitting) → urgent endoscopic capability
- Button battery / magnets / sharp objects → emergent pathways

### GI bleeding
- Large hematochezia, melena, shock, or systemic illness → urgent resuscitation + targeted evaluation
- Infant hematochezia: consider allergic proctocolitis vs infection vs surgical etiologies depending on presentation

## Suggested “minimum workup” reminders (symptom-driven)

### Recurrent abdominal pain (no red flags)
- Prioritize constipation management and functional framework
- Consider selective testing when risk factors exist (family history, growth decline, anemia)

### Suspected celiac disease
- Test while on gluten
- Consider risk groups (type 1 diabetes, first-degree relative)

### Suspected IBD
- Evaluate for anemia/inflammation and stool blood
- Escalate with growth faltering, nocturnal symptoms, or persistent hematochezia
